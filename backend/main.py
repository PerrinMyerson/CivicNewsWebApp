                        2. Give me a 2 page summary of the key sections using these guidelines:
                        - Use a clear, descriptive header for each section of the meeting. If timestamps are included in the transcript, then include the timestamp for when that section began.
                        - Be sure to particularly focus on capturing notable announcements at the beginning of the meeting and public commentary/Q&As, either throughout the meeting or in dedicated sections at the end.
                        - Provide 4-6 detailed bullet points with each containing 2-3 sentences that capture notable points that journalists and community members would want to know, such as:
                            - Specific goals of initiatives or projects
                            - Numeric data points (e.g., budget figures, timelines, statistics)
                            - Key arguments or rationales presented
                            - Notable quotes from participants (with attribution)
                            - Specific plans or strategies discussed
                            - Any decisions made or actions taken
                            - Controversies or disagreements, including the perspectives of different sides
                        - For each proposal or concern raised:
                            - Clearly state the specific proposal or issue
                            - Provide cost estimates or budget implications if mentioned
                            - Outline the pros and cons discussed
                            - Mention any alternatives suggested
                        - For public comments or concerns:
                            - Explain the context or background of the concern
                            - Detail any specific requests or demands made by the public
                            - Include the response from officials or relevant parties, if any
                        - Highlight discussions that will have a significant impact on affected communities.
                        - For contentious issues, clearly outline the different viewpoints, approximate size of each group (if mentioned), and the main points of disagreement. 
                        - Provide a separate section for these contentious issues

                        3. Journalistic Leads
                        Suggest 5 potential article ideas for journalists that would help people in the community develop a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of important topics, each with:

                        - A compelling headline
                        - 2-3 sentences explaining the key questions or angles to explore
                        - Specific data points or quotes from the meeting that support the story's importance â€” use only direct quotes from the transcript with no editing at all.

Thank you. And Chancellor Melissa Avili Ramos. Good evening. Present. Great. So I see the forces with us. Okay. Um, our next order of business is the approval of the minutes from September 25th, 2024. Is there a motion for unanimous consent on the adoption of those minutes?
00:03:14.795 --> 00:03:41.615
Is there a second to the motion? Second. Second. Is there objection to unanimous consent on the approval of the minutes of September 25th, 2024, hearing? No objection. So what if the minutes are adopted? Those minutes are adopted? Yes. I see her hand. Question, panel member, member Caster Ready? Caster ready? I I had been reviewing the minutes and everything looks fine, but it was just something I wanted to suggest for the future.
00:03:41.765 --> 00:04:17.855
At the very bottom of the minutes, it, uh, says resolutions from this meeting are available@theschools.gov website for panel for education policy. But if you go there, it sort of is like a circular mishmash of how to ever find the things related to these minutes. So I was wondering if we could include the link to the contracts with the minutes so that if somebody was planning to go look this over, they actually would know what it means. So Currently there's a summary of the contracts that that's available.
00:04:17.875 --> 00:04:43.725
Are you asking for more than a summary or is a, what Would a summary be sufficient? I, I don't see a summary here. Well, I'm saying that currently we send out a summary of the contracts go is is sent out. Right? The same you're saying that's publicly posted. Okay. Should be attached here. And So you're just like, okay. So Right. Just, just for reference. Okay, fine. Thank you so much. So let me follow up on that and we'll see if we can have that, um, inclusion,
00:04:44.215 --> 00:05:16.825
um, added as well. Thank you. Any other comments? Thank you for your comment. Okay. So ladies and gentlemen, we're gonna begin, uh, uh, today and I'm, and I'm happy to welcome our new chancellor who has joined us on the stage. Um, I, I think this is really, we're beginning a new chapter for our, um, school system, and I think it's gonna be a great new chapter. Um, I'm happy to welcome you to the platform as well. And I think that, um, sends an important message
00:05:16.855 --> 00:05:43.225
that we have the chancellor here with us, um, join joining us on stage. And I really appreciate that. And, uh, that so far in, in, in your, uh, very new administration, the chancellor has really engaged with the panel and it's been available and accessible. And I think that really bodes for a great start for us and a great start for our, uh, uh, uh, new Year. So with that, I'd like to turn it over to our chancellor chair. Ramos floor is yours. Thank you so much, chair.
00:05:43.355 --> 00:06:14.685
And, uh, good evening to everyone. Wanna thank, uh, again, chair Faulkner, vice Chair Dr. Green, and all of our PEP members. Uh, and again, thank you for joining us, uh, earlier this week at our luncheon, uh, for taking time outta your schedule to be with us. Also, wanna acknowledge, uh, MS 1 31 Pace High School and Emma Lazarus High School, the principals here, uh, principal, uh, Gabel, gla, and Gini, as well as Superintendents, McGuire, Edleman, and Sullivan. Thank you so much for hosting us.
00:06:14.685 --> 00:06:44.245
So it's been a, a very busy first few weeks, very exciting. First few weeks I visited schools across the five boroughs, including a community school in the Bronx, an a SD program in Manhattan, a D 79 program in Queens, a New York City read school, and a New York City South School on Staten Island, an early childhood center in Brooklyn. And that's just to name a few. Amy, I also visited your daughter's school Renaissance, which happens to be, uh, in my old high school, uh, my old campus, uh, back at Lehman High School. Uh, so that was great to do that as well.
00:06:44.245 --> 00:07:09.085
As always, I'm amazed by the work that's happening in our schools every single day. There's something for everyone in New York City public schools, and we truly serve the entire city in all of its diversity. And I look forward to continuing our visits and continuing to meet all of you on our travels. Um, all in all, I've jumped right in and it's clear to me that our educators and school communities are building bright starts in bold futures across the city. As I've shared before, I'm committed
00:07:09.145 --> 00:07:33.805
to continuing priorities like New York City reads, New York City solves and our pathways work. Just last week, CUNY Chancellor Matos Rodriguez and I handed out welcome letters to signals to our graduating seniors. There is a place for you at CUNY as long as you finish strong. Also related to pathways, I attended the I Will Graduate event, which is a motivational event for hundreds of high school seniors. And the energy in the room was incredible.
00:07:33.805 --> 00:08:04.095
In addition to these priorities, there are a few other areas that I think we need to be laser focused on, and I have labeled them as my three commitments. So, in order school safety and overall sense of wellness and safety, both physical and emotional for our young people, that is a non-negotiable for me. And that's why last weekend we hosted a terrific community safety forum where agencies from across the city shared resources and listened to families. And I wanna give a special thanks to Chief of Safety and Prevention Partnerships, mark Rampant for pulling
00:08:04.815 --> 00:08:31.935
that together for New York City Public Schools. I believe change is only possible if we work together. And the forum was a great example of that. The other two commitments I plan to zoom in on are teacher support and family and community empowerment. Again, our families need to be at the table when we are making decisions for their children. As a mother, I understand this completely. I look forward to sharing more about my priorities with you all in the coming weeks.
00:08:31.935 --> 00:09:00.085
I also want to acknowledge some of the celebrations that have taken place since we last met. Our Jewish community celebrated the high holidays. We had Hispanic Heritage Month and Italian Heritage Month, both of which we celebrated at SW mm-Hmm, yep. We commemorated Indigenous People's Day, and we have both Halloween and Diwali this week. Apologies. It's our first year with a day off for Diwali. And I'm proud that in New York City public schools, our students, families and staff don't need to choose between school
00:09:00.625 --> 00:09:23.605
and faith or culture. On the topic of holidays, we also announced today that December 23rd will be part of our December break. We heard a lot of advocacy from family, staff, and students on the issues. And I'm committed to hearing from and responding to that feedback. Special thanks to Isaac, the young man who made sure that he sends a letter to the mayor and the Chancellor, uh, who is responsible for this great day. And of course, next week we have our election.
00:09:23.795 --> 00:09:47.605
It's more about important. It's more important now than ever that we teach our students about facts, about their civic duties and about how to engage with others on current events and contentious topics, especially when they disagree. I'm proud of all our civics team has done to support schools leading up to the election, including registering or pre-registered over 85,000 students to vote since 2019. As we head into this momentous chapter of our country's history, I'm confident
00:09:47.605 --> 00:10:21.355
that our students are prepared to be the leaders of tomorrow, no matter the elections outcome. And with that, I wanna turn it back to Chair Faulkner so we can proceed with the meetings. You know, um, this is really a lot of events, a lot of activity, um, hitting the ground running. But I I also wanted to reference, um, civics for all. You know, we've been expanding the Civics for All program, and you made reference to Isaac, the young man who I believe collected 23,000 signatures to really force and suggest a change in the, um, and, uh, uh, on December 23rd.
00:10:21.355 --> 00:10:49.555
So I think that that speaks very well for what we're doing in our schools. It speaks weirdly well about civic engagement. And, um, I'd love for this young man to come to a panel and let's have us officially say something. 'cause I think that was an amazing, uh, thing to have to see, you know, an eighth grader. Um, really, you know, a lot of adults sometimes we're reluctant to, to, uh, accept the challenges of, of, of seeing what we can do with our, um, leadership and experience. And so to see this happen from a young one
00:10:49.595 --> 00:11:14.165
of our students is like, extremely impressive. I think that was one of the best parts of the story for me, that this was a young, uh, one of our students who was able to, to get policy change. And I think that's really important. So, again, thank you Chancellor and, and, uh, you know, I look forward to this, uh, continuing collaboration. Okay, as we move now, we're gonna move into the business portion of tonight's meeting. Um, you know, again, I always wanna recognize the panel
00:11:14.165 --> 00:11:44.525
for the work that has been. It's been a busy few weeks, and I want to thank always the panel for the work that, uh, they've been engaged in. And, um, the meetings and the briefings and other things that, uh, have taken place over the course of the last, uh, month, um, leading up to tonight's meeting. So I just, again, want to acknowledge the work of the, uh, of the panel. Uh, with those special notes outta the way I'd like to move, we'll move into, um, the voting portion of meeting. Um, as we move into the business portion tonight, I want
00:11:44.625 --> 00:12:12.205
to let you know that, um, we'll be calling how we'll be calling people up to speak and, uh, what the rules of engagement will be during that time. Um, during the public comment period, everyone who is signs up to speak on specific agenda items will be allotted up to two and a half minutes. I'm gonna ask our secretary, secretary, Nathan, to please call forward speakers from the signup sheets and keep an eye on the clock to ensure that speakers finish their comments within the allotted time period.
00:12:12.445 --> 00:12:42.755
Additional time will be provided as necessary to help facilitate comments that may require additional translation. We will call speakers up in groups of five. The clock will also indicate the amount of time remaining for each speaker. And a light will flash when there is one minute remaining, so that speakers know when their time is running low. At the conclusion of each speaker's time, we will move on to the next speaker. If the speaker is not present when their name is called, we will move on to the next speaker.
00:12:42.755 --> 00:13:17.135
Once we've done that, that speaker will not be able to redeem their place in the queue. This portion of the public comment is only for agenda items being voted on at tonight's meeting. If you accidentally signed up to comment during this section, but wish to comment on other matters, please see one of our staff members stationed at the microphone who will move you to the open, uh, comment section. Again, comments during this section, um, should only relate to proposals being voted on at tonight's, uh, this evening's meeting.
00:13:17.515 --> 00:13:52.045
Um, do we have, we do have one student signed off as a student. Yeah. Okay. So as we've changed in the past, we have moved the student comment section forward in the meeting. Um, so I don't know if there have, have there any students who might have signed up? Mm-Hmm. Yeah. Um, to speak, Uh, one student signed up for the public comment. Lila Torres, you make your way down to the microphone. Is she here? I don't know. We can call her later again. Okay. If she's not here now, we'll,
00:13:52.215 --> 00:14:17.995
uh, we'll call her again. We'll give her an opportunity to speak, uh, later on during the meeting. Yeah, I do wanna note that, um, Tang has arrived at the meeting. Okay, great. Thank you. Thanks. Okay. The first voting item on tonight's agenda, uh, this evening will be the consideration of contracts. Secretary Nation, could you please introduce the resolution to the panel Panel? Uh, yes. The resolution up
00:14:18.055 --> 00:14:49.015
for approval is entitled Resolution to Authorize Entry into Contracts, which Consists of Contract Agenda Items two through 18. Okay. Is there a motion to consider resolution to authorize entry into contracts? Is there a motion? Is there a second? I, okay. We will now move into public comment regarding the post, uh, resolution. Please note that this portion of the public comment is only for contract items being voted on at tonight's panel meeting.
00:14:49.015 --> 00:15:21.445
If you, again, accidentally signed up to speak on something else, uh, we be able to move you to a later, uh, section of the meeting. Um, so Secretary Nathan? Yes. I'll call five speakers at a time. Uh, David d Gamma, and excuse me if I mispronounce your name. Emily Haynes. Elona Nae, Kamala Carmen and Ra Salas. And when you get to the microphone, just also state your name since I've called a number of speakers at a time. Yeah. Sorry,
00:15:21.445 --> 00:15:56.195
David. Uh, but I was wondering if I could skip, can you bump yourself down or No? Do you wanna just talk into the public comment? Not on the contract? Yeah. Okay. Thank you. Hello. Um, I'll take off my mask to Speak. Thank you. Um, my name's Kamala Carmen. I am a co-founder and a steering committee member of NYC optout. Um, and, um, when the
00:15:56.195 --> 00:16:37.295
periodic assessments were, um, introduced at the tail end of the de Blassio administration, um, we, um, were skeptical of these from, from having heard about MAP and, and, and the other assessments, um, that were already being administered around the country, um, country, and did not have, uh, good reception. Um, so shortly after they were administered for the first time, we, uh, created a, a educator survey, um, where over a hundred, uh, educators responded to this survey about the periodic assessments. And I'm just gonna read to you some of the findings of
00:16:37.995 --> 00:17:10.665
that survey to show that spending $15 million on these periodic assessments is insanity. And it's, um, I, I really urge you to spend our money better. Um, so here's, here's some, uh, some of the things the assessments are no better at identifying students who need support than where the methods teachers were already using. As this was purportedly a major reason for purchasing the test. It points to a major failure of purpose. Among, um, 109 survey respondents.
00:17:10.885 --> 00:17:38.145
Only 2% agreed with the statement quote, the assessment data recently collected identified students who need support, who had not been identified through other means. A literacy coach, um, said, quote, these screeners are insanely time consuming and did not identify any students who were struggling, who had not already been identified using school-based data. This educator had spent more than 14 hours training administrating and re administering and reading reports from the screeners. So-called screeners,
00:17:38.725 --> 00:18:03.265
I would say they're just standardized tests, really. Um, a high school teacher at a school for new immigrants. The majority, our students are ls, both in English and math test. Were administered in English way above their English level. I'm not sure how useful the data is since the language barrier means the test may not have actually been measuring the skills they were designed to measure another teacher. The question, the test questions that I saw were too narrow in scope and did not represent skills that are of value in measuring a student's
00:18:03.445 --> 00:18:32.275
reading and writing potential. The subsequent results provided zero resources for improving student skills, and the lexel reading scores seem wildly off based on demonstrations of skills that I have seen from students outside of the testing experience. Thank You. Good evening. I'm Emily Haynes, uh, New York City Public School teacher. I've been teaching in public schools for the last 27 years, and I believe that New York City teachers are New York City's most passionate.
00:18:32.275 --> 00:19:02.355
I became a teacher because I grew up in the Bronx in public schools. And my life's work is to make sure that we meet every student where they are and help them achieve their highest goals and biggest dreams. And in doing that, over the last 27 years, I've learned that there is no contracts, no app, no curriculum, no assessment that can do this work, but the most passionate, dedicated teachers can. The amount of teaching time we are losing to assessments is another injustice that is being done to our students.
00:19:02.575 --> 00:19:40.915
Our students are snowflakes. And the only people that can measure and love and identify the strengths and needs of those students are the teachers. I can tell you that we now spend three class periods three times a year on these, uh, uh, assessments. The periodic assessments, plus eight entire school days, eight entire school days on mock state exams, plus the four days on the actual state exams. Plus, with the new imposed mandated curriculum from above every single unit, we have to spend three class periods on mid-unit assessments
00:19:40.915 --> 00:20:13.675
and three on end of unit assessments. Which means that in some units, 40% of class time is going to assessing our students. Please let us teach our students. We know our students, we love our students, we believe in our students. But when we have to assess our students constantly, I agree with you a hundred percent chancellor. We want students, we want schools that are every single parent's first choice. And we want safe schools. Our students don't feel safe when we are putting something
00:20:14.065 --> 00:20:47.925
in front of them and making them sit still for hours that we did not create and is not going to help us. That does not make our students wanna come to school. It does not make us as teachers come to school. I am coaching teachers who are now telling me that after years in the classroom, they are miserable. Coming to school, they're miserable. I had a teacher, a first year teacher, who was a para for 20 years, an excellent expert educator who can teach any kid you put in front of him who can diagnose and assess and teach. Any single kid tell me he was gonna become a school
00:20:48.945 --> 00:21:28.515
custodian today because he can't deal with these impositions. Thank you. Thank you. Good evening everyone. Dr. kli Sala Ramirez. I'm a parent in both District four and the consortium. Um, I also wanna talk a little bit about these assessments. Um, when I was your colleague at that table, I spoke a lot about the importance of having culturally responsive education as well as appropriate assessments for our students. These are $15 million that we're going to be committing to assessments that when I go visit schools in Manhattan,
00:21:28.545 --> 00:22:02.635
they tell me that teachers aren't really using the assessments and that it does not align with the curriculum that they are using. And so why are we investing this much money when we have the opportunity to put that money towards teacher training and teacher investment? And that's what we need to do right now, particularly as we have these rollouts of initiatives that are addressing some of the things that we needed to address historically, which again, is to support pedagogical practices that support student learning,
00:22:02.895 --> 00:22:33.875
like problem-based learning and inquiry-based learning. That's where we need to make our investments. We have professionals on the ground that have the ability to provide that. We don't have to pay for outside PD because we have our experts in our classrooms and we have the ability to engage our students in a comprehensive way. And if that weren't true, there wouldn't be an ability or a proposal that's moving forward to actually perform performance based assessments on our high school students for graduation requirements.
00:22:34.195 --> 00:23:05.515
So we continue to rely on standardized curriculum, standardized assessments when children and brains are not standardized. Um, so I wanna continue to lift that. We already spent $23 million on iReady. We're gonna go ahead and spend another $15 million on map and HMHI think we really need to question exactly what we're doing with this. And once again, I didn't see any data connected to the use of these instruments. Um, I I beg you to continue to ask for that data and that validity, um,
00:23:05.515 --> 00:23:39.695
to figure out which schools are the ones that are using these instruments effectively, if at all. Um, because a lot of the people on the ground, including principals, are saying that they already have authentic assessments that help them understand where children need to go. Um, I do also support the special education enhancement, particularly in, in early childhood education. And we need to continue to support our early childhood learners, um, and stop piecemealing these contracts. Thank you.
00:23:39.995 --> 00:24:10.205
Thank you. Uh, Alona a high school teacher in the Bronx. Um, It is incredibly frustrating to see a $15 million contract at the same time that schools budgets are being cut and schools can't afford copies. And long-term subs or paraprofessionals an assessment that does not actually assess the things that we state is assess the things that we state it assesses is make and make sense. These are supposed to be screeners. Screeners should take no more than 20 minutes.
00:24:10.305 --> 00:24:39.405
The fact that we're forcing kids to sit eight hours to take this exam, that then tries to group them into lifestyle and grade bands. When if we're trying to screen for reading comprehension, what would be much more helpful is if it actually broke down the reading skills that these students need. But the screener is, this screener in particular does not do that. It was not designed to screen students for this. So then you have to test kids with two additional tests to try and diagnose exactly what their reading needs are. So now all you're doing is testing, testing, testing,
00:24:39.745 --> 00:25:04.965
and kids don't actually have time to get the supports that they need. Additionally, as teachers, we don't get access to their test scores. So you're having these screeners and the teachers don't ever get to see the data from these screeners. So we can't use it to actually inform our lesson and our curriculum planning. And then lastly, it is really frightening that this is the screener we're purchasing. Uh, at the same time as we're giving millions of dollars
00:25:04.985 --> 00:25:37.365
to H-M-H-H-M-H has now purchased this screener. And it, I can't help but think this is one way that we're really contributing to the privatization of public education. We continue to seek and look outwards and pay these venture capitalists. Veritas Capital has bought up HMH and NWEA and now is bundling it into this one contract. Um, and we continue giving these mon people money to profit off of our children, um, when we have the expertise in-house. Um, so I really urge you all not to pass this contract.
00:25:37.365 --> 00:26:09.615
Um, and instead to give schools that $15 million so that they can pay for their copies and pay for long-term subs, pay for paraprofessionals, and hire more staff. Thank you. Thank you. Um, uh, chancellor Ram would like to comment. Thank you. I'll, I'll start. And then, uh, I'm going to ask, uh, my colleague to jump in and, uh, speak to school budget cuts. So first of all, I wanna thank you so much for your comments, um, on assessment, your insight, deeply appreciated.
00:26:09.795 --> 00:26:52.655
And we are going to set up opportunities to hear directly from teachers and administrators and parents regarding assessment practices, particularly, uh, what we do with data. So I would just wanna thank you and say that you were heard and we appreciate your comment and, uh, if we can have the school budget cuts addressed. Thank you. I know chancellor's working. Thank you, chancellor. Thank you panel. Thank you very much for the, for the comment as well. Um, appreciate it and appreciate the intent.
00:26:52.655 --> 00:27:22.055
So, um, look, we always wanna be putting as much of our money as we can into our schools. Um, even as the city's gone through a couple of rounds of tight budgets, and we've had to look at ways to reduce our budget overall at New York City Public Schools, we've actually increased our spending in schools over the past few years. I realize at the school level there's always more needs and always more we wanna do for our kids. But actually as we look over the past few years, we've increased spending across New York City public schools
00:27:22.515 --> 00:27:52.175
by over a billion dollars. We put in additional money through fair student funding, specifically for students in temporary housing, including all of our asylum seeking students. We put in additional dollars for class size in particular, we've put in additional dollars for teachers and principals as we've reached new collective bargaining agreements and the salaries they need and deserve so they can continue to live here and support our students. Um, and we've also been able to put in additional dollars to backstop a number
00:27:52.325 --> 00:28:16.895
of those stimulus programs like community schools, like Summer Rising, all of these programs that were really built on disappearing money that we thought as we as a city and with the council thought were really important to maintain. So over the past few years, I know it's always tough, but we have actually managed to increase funding into school budgets. Um, we also held schools harmless at the beginning of this year. We'll continue to fight for more. I'll also chancellor, if it's okay, just use this as
00:28:16.955 --> 00:28:51.575
a moment to, to note. As some of you know, there's a way bigger conversation going on about funding for schools in New York State right now. Um, the state, which is a big contributor to our budget, gives us about $10 billion. Um, just in one formula, the state is considering how to change how it funds all the schools in New York State. That's something the state hasn't actually done in a couple of decades. And the formula is way out of date and frankly doesn't take into account the needs of our kids. It doesn't fund our students in temporary housing,
00:28:51.575 --> 00:29:17.575
doesn't adequately fund our students with disabilities, or our English learners doesn't differentiate funding for those students based on their specific needs. Um, doesn't adequately look at the fact that things cost more in New York City as it looks at the dollars we get and doesn't provide additional money for the class size law. So, um, I'm happy to talk more about this, but I say this in part to say this is a fight that's gonna be going on in Albany. It's already going on in Albany. We expect the governor to put some changes in her
00:29:18.075 --> 00:29:45.725
budget early next year. Um, and we really hope we can all work together as a city, as a community. We've been working with advocates in the unions to continue to fight for more funding for New York City schools at this state level as well, uh, to support some of these programs. Thank you. Thank you. Is anyone, I have additional, additional comments. This is comments. Okay. No. Okay. No, we Can. Okay. I
00:29:45.875 --> 00:30:23.275
will call the, um, next group of speakers, um, that is Martina Meyer, Johanna Bjork and Lupe Hernandez. And while they're working their way down, I do wanna note we're joined by two more members of the panel. Um, Tony Giordano and Rema G***o are present at this time. You can begin. Okay. Thank, can you hear me? Yeah. Thank you. Hi, my name is Martina Meyer and I am an employee of the Department of Education. But in speaking right now, as a member of the public,
00:30:23.315 --> 00:30:49.415
a taxpayer and a person who's concerned, I hope you can see our graveyard. This has to do with our concerns related to the ongoing assessments and the impacts of these, um, mandated curricula. I wanna speak first and foremost though, about the, um, desktop and mobile computers, uh, contract item. I'm a former Walder teacher. I hope we know what Waldorf education is and Montessori education and not different philosophies of education. So I'm a former welder teacher, welder trained,
00:30:49.875 --> 00:31:12.975
and I'm also a graduate of welder schools. And, um, for those of you who don't know, there's not an obsession with technology at those schools. And those kids learn how to read. Um, the obsession with technology is a sad and dangerous trend that I see across public schools. We've gotten rid of our technology teachers, nobody's teaching children how to use these devices, but it's just being expected that they know how to type, they know how to double click. They know how to right click. There is no computer literacy
00:31:13.235 --> 00:31:44.095
that's being like, uh, examined. But also, I hope this body doesn't think that we should be like, progressing toward a room of children learning on laptops. Like that's not what great education is. We have the largest school system in the country, and these contracts that we're making have global impact through purchasing these cheap, low quality disposable Chromebook devices. Year after year indefinitely, we are directly perpetuating the ongoing genocide and forced child labor in cobalt mines in the Congo.
00:31:44.195 --> 00:32:14.825
Our purchases have direct impacts. And I think this outfit is not an exaggeration. Like we are directly responsible for the continued death and genocide of children, of, of human beings inside of cobalt minds. And it's all because we wanna have, make sure that we have these really cheap laptops in everybody's hands. I'm taking a moment to just honor the, the lives of those children. How can we in good conscious spend our money this way? Why are these devices designed with built in death dates?
00:32:15.205 --> 00:32:42.085
This is incredibly wasteful and irresponsible. We should be using the weight of these contracts, the weight of our power as the largest school system in the country, to demand longer lifespan for each device, and a more comprehensive and internalized plan for maintaining and supporting these devices. It pains me to see that we are continuing to purchase ad nausea, these replacement and very disposable devices. I agree with everything that was previously stated about the periodic assessment.
00:32:42.245 --> 00:33:14.045
I teach students who are dual language learners. I have a lot of newcomers and they had to take a lot of assessments in English. I don't understand why we are assessing children in a language that they don't speak. It doesn't gimme any additional information, and it takes away from my ability to give them the instruction that they need. Thank you. I, uh, my name is Johanna Bjork. I am the parent of a 10th grader at, uh, uh, high school, just down the street from here
00:33:14.705 --> 00:33:49.725
in the Murray Bergstrom building. Um, and I really hope chancellor, that when you say that you wanna hear from parents that, you mean parents like me, parents who elected to send their child to a school that is not screened, um, who want their child to have a, an educational experience with students of diverse types of academic learners. Because I feel like in the past few, few years, the emphasis has gone the other direction. But this is, is about contracts and it is about the assessments. I, as a parent, I have received the scores.
00:33:49.725 --> 00:34:13.525
I've been looked to see what the assessments are and how my child did. It's meaningless. It gives me no information. I wanna know if my child is doing well and I only see a score that says he's, his math is at a 12th grade level. Well, what does that mean? I have to talk to the teacher to understand what he, where he struggles, where he doesn't, and then learn, well, actually this is really not very meaningful because it, it isn't measuring or aligned with the curriculum whatsoever.
00:34:13.785 --> 00:34:47.225
And we're spending so much money on it. And yet it ends up being used to shame Schools like the school, my school child attends and elevate for reasons that have nothing to do with the instructional practices, but only have the re the, to do with the fact that schools handpick their students. The schools that do well on these assessments. I re I can't, I am a data person. I love spreadsheets more than probably anybody in this room. Um, I adore looking at data. Um, and I also work for the DOE.
00:34:47.325 --> 00:35:13.305
So I, I say this knowing I'm here as a parent, but I, I use this data. I'm, uh, one of my things I try to do is get this information to be useful to teachers and over and over and over again, it's banging my head against the wall because it doesn't tell them anything they don't already know. It doesn't come to them in a format that they can. Teaching is one of the few professions where you don't sit in front of a computer all day. And yet we're asking our teachers to try
00:35:13.465 --> 00:35:57.025
to digest this information, which doesn't come to them in any sort of way that relates whatsoever to what they're doing in the classroom. And we're gonna spend $50 million on it. It's crazy. It's meaningless. There's a saying, garbage in, garbage out. And that is 100% what I see with the map and acas. Thank you. Good evening. My name is Lupe Hernandez and I'm speaking this evening in my own personal capacity as a New York City public school parent. Um, I'll start off with just a couple favors of agenda items eight and five.
00:35:57.665 --> 00:36:28.745
That's the extension of, uh, multifunctional devices, um, notebooks and mobile computers for our students, as well as the enhancement of special education for early childhood. Um, also, yes, on agenda item number three, I wanna raise and highlight to you guys that older students who are not immediately college bound are not less important. They may be the ones to save us from staffing shortages that harm our younger students. In particular, these are high vacancies of school bus drivers, monitors, mechanics, paraprofessionals, positions
00:36:29.085 --> 00:37:01.065
that do not require a college degree, but are something to be proud of. The unstaffed bus routes are causing to absences for students from classes and therapies, related services, absences from parents that go to work. Many parents have lost their jobs. Um, in regard to item agenda number three, we would like to implore for DOE to actually look into PD involving helping CTE programs leaders and approach entities that hire for such positions and or with the state run and
00:37:01.485 --> 00:37:31.115
or union run apprenticeship programs. So maybe a CTE co-op Tech and Pathways are used to strategically make a pipeline into service jobs that support better attendance and safety. And it's a win-win for all. Know no on a agenda item number two, I'll see, try to do this as quickly as possible at a time when schools are experiencing serious of staffing issues. Pulling educators away from to train or administer and interpret tests for dubious utility is unacceptable
00:37:31.345 --> 00:38:04.235
and unconscionable. This amount of money is truly a waste. And I will tell you, as a parent who opts out of all assessments and state tests, I speak with my son's teachers regularly and they assure me, and they, I'm very confident in their ability to be able to assess where my son is at and meet him where he needs to be. 59% of survey respondents that was taken showed that students showed a sign of stress because they were being tested on end of year benchmarks. 65% of a survey from respondents reported
00:38:04.235 --> 00:38:31.405
that administering these assessments interfered with our ability to actually assess trauma-informed practices. The third grade teacher ICT from Brooklyn spent quoted, I spent much time building back kids after taking these tests because they felt so badly taking the test and didn't understand. It's unclear whether schools have actually been able to use this. As we've heard from educators tonight, they don't actually get to see this data.
00:38:31.415 --> 00:39:05.565
It's useless. Please put this money where we can really support our students. Thank you. That is the end of the public comment. Okay. Uh, contract items. Great. Thank you. And I wanna thank members of the public who came out and thank you for your, uh, for your comments. We will now transition to panel member comments. And I'm looking at Tom Shepherd 'cause I guess correctly that you would have your hand raised. So Panel Member Shepherd.
00:39:05.705 --> 00:39:44.495
Thank you. Um, I wanna start by saying thank you to the public who comes out month after month and speaks on these contracts and how they work or don't work for our school system and our students in particular. I'm sitting here this month and I'm looking at these numbers and it's not lost on me that we're spending almost as much to repair the sidewalks as we are in special education. And I got a problem with that, right? Like million and a half dollars for repair
00:39:45.235 --> 00:40:27.205
of asphalt pavement and $1.57 million in, um, um, one point, uh, 1.7 million for special education enhancements. Something just doesn't sound or feel right about that. And I've been sitting here for almost four and a half years across four chancellors and, you know, dozens of assessments that we've approved, you know, to the tune of, you know, dozens if not close to a hundred million dollars. And, you know, dozens of assessments that
00:40:27.595 --> 00:41:08.485
I couldn't tell you if they work or not, because nobody's ever come back and told us how they work or whether they work, right? And, you know, the community has a problem with that. And so do I, you know, when we look at this month when we're spending, you know, $85 million for, you know, notebooks and mobile computers, and you couple that with, you know, I mean, where do you go from here? Like $28 million on copy machines and, you know, all kinds of stuff. But then at the, at the same time, you know, we have schools
00:41:09.145 --> 00:41:45.145
that still don't have enough teachers. We have schools where, you know, our kids are, you know, placed in a position of spending more time in front of a computer and less time in front of a teacher. And that doesn't make any of us feel good. And you know, I've said before, and I'll say it again, at what point when we look at assessments, do we say to ourselves that enough is, is enough, right? When we are talking about assessments that assess the assessments that assess the assessments, that assess the assessments, we, we have
00:41:45.325 --> 00:42:15.265
to start asking ourselves at what point, like, do we just put a pause on this, evaluate what we already have, and then report back to the public about what's working and what's not? And then the last thing here, um, because, you know, we've been having some real conversations about, you know, you know, student privacy and data privacy and what that means. Um, and, you know, there's, there's no real understanding here of how student data
00:42:15.335 --> 00:42:52.275
and family data is being used. What it's being used for. Um, you know, you know, is this information, like there was a teacher spoke, said that she doesn't even get like the information from these assessments for her own classroom. Like so at what, so you have to ask yourself, well, if the teacher that's sitting in front of these children, um, doesn't have access to the assessment data for their own students, then who has that data and what are they doing with it? And, you know, at the end of the day,
00:42:52.275 --> 00:43:31.635
I am not comfortable voting yes on contract items. Number two, I am not comfortable. Um, you know, I will probably abstain, um, from all of these, you know, stuff, contracts. Um, but I think, you know, at a time when we are, um, when schools are sitting around looking at their budget shrink, um, we need to take a hard look at these contracts and we have to have a different kind of conversation that says, you know, if if students in special education are a priority, then we need to invest in that.
00:43:31.635 --> 00:44:02.715
If students in schools that don't have enough teachers are a priority, then we need to invest in that. And we have to take a look at all these other things and tell ourselves, is this like, does this serve the best interest of our students? Does it serve the best interest of our teachers? Does it serve the best interest of our communities? And if there's any hesitation on any of those three questions, then we should not be, um, considering those contracts. Um, so with that said, um, I want to thank you.
00:44:03.375 --> 00:44:46.195
Uh, oh, there is one other thing I wanna speak to. And that is agenda item number six. Um, the, the heat and hot water for co-op city schools. The, the schools around, um, co-op City, um, for River Bay. Now, you know, my kids went to school in in district 11. My, um, youngest daughter went to 180 1, which is one of the schools here. She's in, she's in high school now. But, you know, I understand that, um, you know, it's important to make sure that we have heat and hot water in our schools. Um, but I also think that we should be looking at, um,
00:44:46.335 --> 00:45:27.245
especially with a lot of these older school buildings, how do we modernize these school buildings or retrofit them or upgrade them in a way, um, where we are not looking at, you know, millions of dollars, you know, paid out to, um, a utility. Uh, 'cause River Bay in co-op City is a utility. Um, and you know, this is a one year contract. I believe it's an extension. Um, I think we need to really take the time to go through the schools in co-op City and make sure that, um, anything
00:45:27.615 --> 00:46:05.335
that we can do to upgrade those schools, especially when the city has committed, um, to, you know, renewable energy, to solar, to these kinds of, um, uh, upgrades to our infrastructure and really invest that kind of money into upgrading the older schools in co-op City. Um, and, you know, I will support a one year extension, but, um, you know, it, you know, anything longer than that, um, I do think that we need to have a different kind of conversation. Thank you Chair Faulkner and I yield best. Sure. Thank you. Um, chancellor Pleasures,
00:46:05.335 --> 00:46:39.665
Thank you. Panel Member Shepherd. Um, we do have Chief Dr. Mia Pay who can respond to some of the assessment, uh, concerns. And then we also have, I believe, uh, chief Moran, Kevin Moran, if you are here, uh, if you're able to respond. So thank you for all the comments. I wanted to just hone in on one particular part about the teachers and just really kind of demystify. So the design of the assessments that students are taking. Two things to note. Every teacher has direct access
00:46:40.445 --> 00:47:25.785
to their students results. And also every assessment provides a teacher portal where teachers have direct access to their results. Now, if there is anyone who knows of a teacher, or maybe they are a teacher who does not have direct access to your students' assessment data, that is a problem. So I want to just make sure my email is mpa@schools.nyc.gov. You can email me directly, and I will ensure that we investigate exactly what the challenges are for any teacher within the city who is having problems assessing and
00:47:26.575 --> 00:48:02.965
or receiving the data from their students assessment information. Now, clarity teachers do not have citywide access to any student's data, but they do have direct access to their students' data. So I just want to make sure, um, that you know, that we are adamantly committed to ensuring that teachers have the access in real time to make the decisions that they need connected to instruction and ensuring that they are clearly aware of the gaps that students may have so
00:48:03.105 --> 00:48:36.515
that effective intervention can be provided to students. So again, that email is m as in Maria, P as in Peter, a t e@schools.nyc.gov. I just wanna thank you, Dr. Thank you for that clarification. Uh, hello, Kevin Moran, uh, chief of School Operations. Uh, thank you chancellor and thank you Member Shepherd. Uh, a couple things just as it relates to the, uh, sidewalks. Uh, we're very fortunate to have a collaboration with the New York City Department of Transportation. They handle sidewalk repairs.
00:48:36.935 --> 00:49:07.635
Um, we're very enthused to bring together, uh, a variety of vendors. And in this instance for the asphalt vendor, an MWE vendor to help us with asphalt repairs. Uh, we have some, uh, square footage, uh, that is, uh, in the tens of thousands around the boroughs that is playground specific, uh, where kids play and where cracks could surface over time. Uneven where we need an asphalt asphalt vendor. So this $500,000 each year will allow us to get to our 1400 physical plants, fix any trip hazards or issues around the school perimeter.
00:49:08.055 --> 00:49:41.115
Uh, so we're really enthused about that, uh, contract. Um, as it relates specifically to co-op City, the way the co-op was established in the late sixties and into early seventies was an engineering marvel to itself. Our schools weren't constructed with boilers themselves. Uh, we pair off of, uh, like all the residents and properties on, uh, the, the, the River Bay Management co-op. Uh, we rely on them for heat, um, and hot water. Um, to build out boiler rooms in a traditional sense or upgrade would take some doing.
00:49:41.115 --> 00:50:05.475
So I agree with you, Tom, looking at it at this year, just as an extension of terms, um, to figure out what is the best approach. There's competing interest around electrification. What does that mean? And and again, we don't have boiler rooms, so it's loss of space and there's some trade offs here. Um, and there's some real value add to the system. There's not a full-time employee assigned to run the systems in the physical plant to bring up the heat, to bring up the hot water. They're turning a valve.
00:50:05.475 --> 00:50:30.675
Um, it comes straight into the building so we don't have to sign full-time employees to, to run the physical boilers. But all that to say, we're gonna look at the options, some of the options that we didn't have, type of this services like a temporary boiler. You've seen them in the street when we seek to upgrade, um, as we're required to do, they have the, the, they look like tractor trailers and they're, they're cordoned off with barriers and they have a large stainless stack that runs alongside the building. And, uh, Jess, I know you said you had one
00:50:31.175 --> 00:50:58.235
and you guys celebrated in the street when it was gone. Um, uh, but that is a product of, of the upgrade itself. So what do you do in the interim? But these are all very interesting conversations. Um, I had offered, and I I I, I extend the offer again to anyone who wants to go up to Cobb City. Uh, I think Ream already said, yes, Tom, I know you're nearby. Uh, to see the physical plants, to see the complexities and to have open and honest conversations about what is the service that we get here with this contract item and what are the trade-offs.
00:50:58.515 --> 00:51:24.315
Um, and just on top lines, 'cause it was raised it to put a heat pump system in every classroom in, in all the plants across that campus, $440 million to upgrade that and to assign $500,000 a year to run those systems. Um, and to change out a boiler to try to do an electric boiler. Again, those spaces, but we, we had that somewhere, uh, in excess of a hundred million dollars. Um, and so we see this as a, as a, as a pretty efficient system.
00:51:24.335 --> 00:51:56.535
Um, but I encourage the conversation going forward about how, uh, folks can opine look at these, the financials and so we can make a better decision together about a contract term. And what are the trade-offs, uh, before we go forward. Thank, thank you for that. I know we had a really great briefing, uh, from your team discussing exactly all of those, uh, all of those concerns and issues and, uh, those things that are, make it a little bit more complicated. So I'm glad that that's gonna be an ongoing discussion. Any other panel? Yes. Yes. Go ahead. Panel member Alvin.
00:51:56.535 --> 00:52:31.325
Okay. So, um, first I'm gonna say that these assessments are usually not really for the school level, right? I it is more for the district, the borrower, citywide level. The teachers are the best way of assessing, but I'm not hearing that they're not getting the data or they're not getting the results. They are the, the issue is our scholars are, are beyond tests. If we keep increasing assessments, that's taking away from their learning and enjoying school. Not every, all students aren't test takers, right?
00:52:31.325 --> 00:52:56.085
And that's not the only way we should be assessing our children, right? There's too many assessments. And this is what I'm hearing, right? We have all these assessments. We may need to restrategize how we assess our students maybe is less because real life, yeah. Occasionally we take tests, but real life we are not taking tests all the time. 40% of the time we're not taking tests. So if we're trying to reimagine the school experience,
00:52:56.475 --> 00:53:29.245
increasing assessments, that's not part of it. Some of them going to clam up under pressure. Why We gotta take a test every time we gotta take a test. I gotta take a test that is not making education fun. This is not, um, being, um, project based managing to see how it relates to real life. We are not always taking tests. So I think that is what I'm hearing, right? But the data, I have to say the data is being used but not at the school level. And we really don't want our teachers and at the school level assessing students solely on tests
00:53:29.665 --> 00:54:00.165
because that doesn't show the whole student, right? So that, that is what's being said, not about accessing the results of the assess the assessments is what it's doing to a lot of the children and the learn teaching, right? It's taking away from the teaching time of the subject because we have to do assessments, which will help maybe the district to give it an overall thing, but it's not helping the teachers at the school level. And we want to make sure our school levels, uh, the students, our scholars, our children,
00:54:00.585 --> 00:54:25.605
is getting the education they want. And, and it's enjoyable, right? You know, the students who like, okay, it's a test day. I'm not gonna show up because I don't do well. We don't want that to happen. And we need to feel that the whole academic career is based on a test, right? Our children are beyond the test. That's what is being said today. Not about access to information. That is what they're trying to protect. This is what I'm getting. I'm just gonna say that's
00:54:25.985 --> 00:54:58.725
what I'm getting from the public comments. And I agree with the assessment, you know, you know, agree what they're saying about too many assessments, but the, it is unnecessary, uh, the case. Now I don't plan to vote yes for number two for other reasons, right? Because we do got too many assessments. But it is, is necessary to get a overall view how New York City Public Schools is doing. It's not gonna give a accurate picture, but it will give us something right to go on. Because again, the district, the city is not at the school.
00:54:59.145 --> 00:55:32.685
They're not dealing with the children's directly. So then we leave it to our teachers to assess them. Um, so it's just for data for the computers to give a measurement. And in that case, so I just wanna clarify, this is what the parents are saying, uh, in regards to, uh, these assessments. It shouldn't take up so many, so much of their time teaching the students, right? And we need to come up with better assessments, uh, so we can assess them when needed, but not so much. 'cause we are going to technology, they're already doing
00:55:32.985 --> 00:56:09.255
state exams gonna be online. The SA is going online, the AP exams online. We, you know, we're all beyond the technology. It's too not personal, right? It's too personal. If they have to take these tests online, let's eliminate some, you know, reduce the amount. We know it's necessary, but let's try to reduce and be more, um, how say more effective and impactful when we do do the assessments. Let those assessments do what they should do. Instead of doing multiple assessments, like I think Tom said elegantly assess
00:56:09.435 --> 00:56:38.725
the assess the assess. You know, if all these things are working, we need to be more effective and more use of our time. Um, and so the teachers can actually do what they're supposed to do in the classroom. And kids don't feel intimidated that all I go to school is just to do a test. Right? So that, I think that is what's being clarified here. Um, for, so it could be clear, it's not about getting information about the test scores. We know what the test scores are. We might not know specific assessments,
00:56:38.725 --> 00:57:09.605
but of course we get the state exam. That is not what they're talking about. They don't know how the data is being used. But I'm saying it is being used at the district level, right? It should be talked about at the district leadership team. What, how they using these assessments, what are those results are, because the district comprehension education plan is supposed to be based on those assessments. This is what I'm trying to, trying to clarify here. So if your DLT or your SLT
00:57:09.605 --> 00:57:38.285
or whatever is not doing, get those information, you can get that information right for your school or for your district. There. They, you know, there is the structure in place for that. Um, I was gonna say something else, but I think I took enough time, but I just wanna re I want us to, the goal is, and it's everybody's goal 'cause we're not gonna agree is the children, what is best for the children and all these assessments. It, it's not, it's, it's, it is just too much. Okay. Thank you. pem Alban,
00:57:38.345 --> 00:58:17.265
I think I saw Pem AIA with, or was it? Yes. Yeah. Panel member. Hello everyone. Adriana, she, her, um, I have a couple of of things to know. There's been a lot said about contract item number two already, so I won't say anything else there. But I do have a couple of concerns. Um, I am inclined to believe the teachers when they say that they do not have access to their students' testing data assessment, data assessment records, because these people are people I trust with my son, right? So I don't think that they would lie to me or lie to us.
00:58:17.365 --> 00:58:44.525
Um, in that, in that though, uh, who's, who sees the data in that case, the, the testing folks see it and they keep it. Why are they keeping it? Um, because we know that testing data is sold and it's also tracked to see where your kid is likely to go to high school. And then based on that, how they're likely to do on their SAT. And based on that, they can advertise to them for colleges, et cetera, et cetera. So if our teachers aren't seeing the results,
00:58:45.065 --> 00:59:19.505
but the testing company is seeing it, are they keeping it? How often are they reviewing it? And then are they deleting it? Are they scrubbing our students', PII from their systems? Uh, my second question is, um, regarding the lack of computer science education that we have, there's been a lot of conversation so far about our students taking assessments online and taking their state exams online now. And the shiza is going to be moving online as well, as has already been mentioned this evening. But we're not teaching our children how
00:59:19.965 --> 00:59:46.645
to do simple things like type. And I know from principals in my neck of the woods in Queens that there is no time in the school day currently to add a, a, a period where the tea, the children are taught how to type, or the children are taught computer science, or the children are taught how to navigate an interface, or the children are taught how to build a computer from scratch. These are all things I learned as a New York City public school student in the two thousands. It's a long time ago, but
00:59:47.335 --> 01:00:18.785
technology's gotten better since then. So I would hope that our teaching of it had gotten better too, but that is not the case, unfortunately. Um, and the last item that I would like to address is an agenda item number 16. This is yet another consultant for DIIT. Can we please just get them a full-time person? Please? Please. Thank you. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Panel member. Um, any other panel members? Wish panel member Lee? Thank you. Um, so I,
01:00:19.205 --> 01:00:54.395
I know I brought this up about contract item number eight, uh, in our briefing. Um, but I guess I'm still wondering, uh, because I don't think I got a really sufficient answer, but these $85 million, um, in desktops and laptop computers, I know that some of them are going to central offices. Those are not the ones I'm concerned about. But for the ones that, um, are theoretically headed towards our schools, I would like to know more about what mechanisms are in place to ensure there's an equitable distribution of these devices
01:00:55.135 --> 01:01:38.075
to ensure that all schools, regardless of enrollment, um, get to have the same kind of ratios of laptops or tablets to students. Um, because we know that our lower enrolled schools have smaller budgets because we fund students and not schools. Um, and, you know, as all of our assessments move to digital versions, when we under resource low, lower lowly enrolled schools in this particular manner, what we are doing is under equipping students to perform and students to be assessed accurately. We are exacerbating the digital divide if we don't have a
01:01:38.655 --> 01:02:13.075
mechanism in place to ensure equitable distribution. Um, and so I'm really puzzled by this. I would love it if somebody could explain how this works. Um, because, you know, as Adriana mentioned, we don't want, we're in the business here of increasing educational opportunities and economic opportunities, but if we're not providing kids with the actual digital infrastructure to do so, then we are exacerbating the preschool to prison pipeline. We are exacerbating the digital divide, and we are exacerbating socioeconomic divide, you know, here.
01:02:13.515 --> 01:02:44.095
So if somebody could help me with this. Thank you. Thank you, chancellor. Thank you so much. Um, both panel member Ali and um, Hannah, member, uh, Lee. So we have some, uh, responses. If somebody from, uh, OPE, Ette, I believe you're here, or Dan can speak to the assessment piece. And then Shaquille, if you chief, um, Shaquille, if you can also speak to the devices comment. Thank you. And specifically I'd just like to know about the distribution, um, and equitable distributions.
01:02:45.195 --> 01:03:16.295
Yes. Hi. Uh, good afternoon. Uh, chief Information Officer, uh, in terms of the contract that you're referring to, this is a requirement contract, which allows school to use this contract however they want to. Uh, it's, uh, it's not limiting any school based on, um, uh, uh, uh, DI City or anything like that. This is just a requirement contract. So a school has budget. They can use this contract to buy any devices that they want. So, uh, there's no limitation, uh, based on this contract at this point time. But we
01:03:17.125 --> 01:03:57.265
Don't, we don't do anything sort of help under-resourced schools. Lowly enrolled schools had their budgets to access new technology or replace broken technology. I, I think, uh, our, uh, chief Operating Officer, Emma, she addressed that the budget has increased, but I would ask Emma to respond on. So, um, thanks for the question and thank you, Shaquille. Um, so we do leave, we do give our school some options about what types of devices they want for their students. And so these devices, this Lenovo contract and some of the others are devices that make it possible
01:03:57.325 --> 01:04:24.665
for schools to purchase contracts. And Central, they don't require any particular spend. No, you know, that, but just so we're clear about the amounts, um, I mean, as I said before, we, we have continued where we can to pour money directly into school budgets, both for staff, but also for other costs like this. We have increased those dollars over time. We have held schools harmless that have lost enrollment at the beginning of this year. Um, we, we do actually have a lot of devices in our schools at this moment in time.
01:04:25.015 --> 01:04:53.115
Is the, is the truth. That doesn't mean there might not be some places where that's not true. And I'd say two things about that. One is going into the winter as a test of the system, we are having all of our schools and all of our superintendents at the actual school level do a, um, remote learning test. But a piece of that is going to be do you have devices for your students? Do they have devices? Do you have devices you can send home for your students?
01:04:53.115 --> 01:05:19.245
And the case of an actual remote learning need, we think that's going to give us good data at the school and superintendent level in terms of where there are needs and where we really hold schools to it. They still think they need additional devices. We do then think there, there is funding and budgets for that where there is not, our schools will come to our division of school leadership and note where they think they have a real need that there can't be space for in their budget. And we, we will take a look at that as well. And this test we're doing is gonna happen next week,
01:05:19.395 --> 01:05:45.305
and we should have a better sense of that. Okay. Thank you. That's really helpful information. And within that test renewing, is there, um, are you also assessing the, like, the status of the devices in terms of whether or not they're functioning, like to ensure that schools are not distributing devices that don't work? Yes. So part of good question. Um, part of the, the part, part of the evaluation we're doing next week. Yeah, next week, part of the evaluation we're doing next
01:05:45.535 --> 01:06:12.545
week, weeks are going very quickly. Part of the evaluation we're doing next week is all students are going to need to log on. So it's going to be a test of does the device work, whatever device they're using. It might not be our device, but does the device work? Do they know how to log on? Do the teachers know how to post an assignment? Do the students know how to do one? So it should test each of those pieces of the system, uh, for usage. And how granular is like, I guess I, I, is is the data
01:06:15.695 --> 01:06:43.215
that's collected through that attached to IDs specifically? Yes. We will be looking down to the school level. So principals can know what's happening in their school by, by whether or not they're working student by student, student by student. Okay. We, we, we'll, I think some of this could be held to a, at a briefing. Okay. So, um, I, I want it to be give some latitude to, you know, have some questions, but, um, I think some of this is more appropriate for a, a a, a specific briefing on some of these topics. Is there anyone other panel members?
01:06:43.215 --> 01:07:29.955
Panel members, well, let me go around and make sure there's no other panel member who wishes to speak first and then come back. Uh, yes. Panel member. Um, Ca Ca i, I don't know, ca Well actually, Laura had her hands up even before, So you wanna yield the floor to Yeah, go ahead. You sure? Yeah. Okay. I move this forward. Sure. Thank you. Uh, panel member Cass. Ready. Um, I would like to, uh, reiterate some comments about a couple of, um, agenda items and also, um, asks questions on a couple of others,
01:07:30.375 --> 01:08:08.855
um, on agenda item number two. Um, really appreciate the chancellor's comments and, uh, not trying in any way to pile on. Um, but our office would really like to uplift the public comments tonight on agenda item number two. And reiterate something that I did mention in a recent meeting with the chancellor, um, that our office has heard, um, from multiple teachers and principals, um, on MAP testing. And they have almost all told us, um, that while measuring student progress is important
01:08:08.955 --> 01:08:55.305
and essential, that these particular assessments, map assessments, which are mandated three times a year, take valuable time, resources and staff capacity away from instruction with no obvious benefit over less intrusive assessment options. And without any New York City specific data on the impact these assessments have had on student outcomes, I wanna reiterate what others have said and uplift the idea that it is time to pause and reassess whether investing another $15 million into these assessments make sense.
01:08:55.825 --> 01:09:32.345
At this point, these assessments were introduced to capture pandemic learning, loss and recovery. And what data do we have on the benefits of these assessments before we enter into another five year contract? Um, I'd like to ask about agenda item number four. Um, it was a little over two years ago that former deputy chancellor, Kara Med dismissed instructional coordinators from their roles in providing three K and pre-K programs with professional development and support.
01:09:32.345 --> 01:10:13.705
Um, this mtac has been around for a while. It's definitely not new, but I guess, um, it would be good to know, is this the only remaining source of staff development, um, that these three K and pre-K providers have? Is it just these vendors, um, that are providing WIM with the, um, the professional development they need at this point? What, if any, other supports do our essential CBO early childhood education providers have in terms of instructional support other than these contracts? Um, on agenda item number five, um, super glad to see this.
01:10:13.785 --> 01:10:55.725
Um, and glad to hear recently from, um, deputy Chancellor Fody that the $25 million investment in, in-house special education and skis classes is happening. Um, it would be great, um, if the panel could get an update on the current number of preschool age children with disabilities, still waiting for a special education preschool seat nearly two months after the start of the current school year. And finally, um, I would like to, um, provide a last comment on agenda item number six. Um, I want to uplift, um, what the panel member from the Bronx, um, said earlier.
01:10:56.305 --> 01:11:32.285
I want to thank Chief Moran for his work on this and would just like to mention, um, a few things about this contract. Um, the contract with River Bay dates to 1971 when natural gas fueled co-generation plants were reviewed as a green alternative to energy sources such as coal and oil. But that was a long time ago. And as our office mentioned previously in the recent contracts briefing, the vendor has a wage theft violation that has landed them on our employer wall of shame. There is a pending wage theft lawsuit noted in
01:11:33.945 --> 01:12:07.085
the RA as well. Therefore, we are super glad to see that DOE has followed up on our recommendation at the briefing to take this opportunity to evaluate whether electrification might be an alternative for these schools with a new feasibility study. And by reducing the contract term to one year from five years to allow the Department of Education to evaluate that study before entering into a long-term contract. This is especially relevant given the mayor's leading the charge commitment of $4 billion two years ago
01:12:08.545 --> 01:12:49.005
to electrify schools. New York's electrical grid is in transition right now as we move toward greener energy sources such as offshore wind. If our goal is truly to rid our schools of dependence on fossil fuels, an investment like this would be a good one as we work to meet our city's climate targets and decarbonize our grid. Thank You. Thank you. iia. There's some responses from the, the, uh, department
01:12:49.005 --> 01:13:12.235
To all the Panel to all the panel. Okay. I thought, I Think that well wait minute. Well hold it. Are there any other panel members before you start, any other panel members who wish to comment? Oh, I'm sorry. Come here. Sorry. Can I just jump in really quickly? We're gonna ask the team if we could just hold until the panel members make their comments and then we will all respond appropriately. Thank you so much. Thank you so much.
01:13:12.335 --> 01:13:48.025
Um, so I wanted to let everybody know that when I am reviewing these contracts, I try to keep our vision and mission at heart. And so I'd like to read to you all quickly what is on the panel for education policy website. The panel believes that education is a fundamental human right. It is our duty to ensure that all students have equal access to the opportunity and resources needed to reach their full potential. The P'S commitment to New York City families is
01:13:48.125 --> 01:14:25.815
to forge the key to a brighter future for all families of New York City. The panel is committed to ensuring every student has an education of the highest quality, fortified by a curriculum of inclusion and pride, and that children will be prepared for success in college and career imbued with a sense of action and engagement as a responsible member of society. I have looked at this language at least six times in the last few days, and I try to really keep that at the heart of what I do.
01:14:26.165 --> 01:15:13.535
So when I see contracts like the one that was refu removed, item number one for $17 million of testing, item number two, $15 million of testing. And item number 14, which may have just sort of been outside of anybody's radar for 210,000 for delivery services, of testing materials, I add that up to $32,210,000. And I wonder to myself, where could that money go? And then I look at, and then I look at the rest of these contracts, things like family and community engagement services
01:15:16.095 --> 01:16:07.675
for early childhood education, $150,000 special education enhancement, 1.7 million extension for early learn services, 8 million UPK, half day and UPK extensions, 1.3 million. And then education programs for students initiatives 112,000. That comes to barely one third of what we're spending on testing. I think we really need to think about our values and mission when we're looking at these contracts. And so I'll just stop there. Thank you. Okay. Any other, any other panel members wish to comment?
01:16:09.225 --> 01:16:47.225
Panel member Sheard. Thank you, chair Faulkner. I'll make this one quick 'cause I forgot to add it the first time. Um, but I've mentioned over the years, um, that we really do, and this is agenda item number seven, we really do need to take a look at, um, you know, how we, um, fund, um, Bard High School early college in a way where we don't have to keep coming back here every year or every other year, um, you know, to, to fund, um, you know, this particular program that, um,
01:16:47.525 --> 01:17:24.965
is wildly popular throughout the city, right? We, we've opened, uh, Bard High School, early college in Bronx, and we've recently opened, uh, Bard High School, early college in Brooklyn. And I am sure that the majority of the lion's share of this 1.8 million, um, is really going into making sure that the college part of Bard High School early college, uh, is, is fully funded, um, for the Bronx and Brooklyn, which is cool. Um, but it, you know, we, we are guaranteeing, uh, that our students
01:17:25.185 --> 01:18:10.925
that graduate New York City public high schools, uh, will, you know, can automatically go to a cuny um, school. And, you know, there's, there's no question about what that costs or anything. We, we made that commitment and we said we're gonna do it. And I am just asking a chancellor if perhaps, um, you can have the types of conversations with, um, CUNY with state, um, and with Bard, and let's figure out how we can, uh, sustainably fund, um, the Bard High School early college programs across the city in a way, um, where funding for both sides of that program, the, the high school side
01:18:11.585 --> 01:18:52.655
and the early college side, um, are just fully funded, um, and sustainably. So. Thank you. Any other panel members? Yes, panel members. Good. Um, good evening. So what I heard when I was listening to the, the comments about assessments and receiving the results and the mechanisms within New York City Public Schools to address, which is, um, school leadership team and district leadership team, what I hear is that there's a breakdown in the functionality and the integrity of the way these groups function,
01:18:52.655 --> 01:19:21.175
and that these teams are not actually doing the job that they're supposed to, which is mandated in New York State Education law 25 90. And so when we hear teachers telling us that are supposed to be on these teams, and we hear parents telling us that they're supposed to be on these teams and we hear CEC members telling us, and they're supposed to be on these teams, then that's a breakdown in the, the engagement structure developed to meet the mandate of the state law. So I think the better conversation is
01:19:21.475 --> 01:19:52.415
how do we revisit S SLT than DOT and ensure that they're functioning with integrity, and that they are actually getting the information and having the conversations that they're supposed to and not being given a document to sign that they have no idea what it means. Second, um, the assessments, the assessments are not for everybody, and we spend a whole lot of money on it. Um, I don't really see a whole lot being done to differentiate the assessments for students that learn differently, to differentiate the assessments for students that may be alternately assessed
01:19:52.415 --> 01:20:20.125
to differentiate for students that may speak a different language. And that work falls on the teachers with what time do they have left. So I really wanna, like, and again, this is an SLT conversation about assessment and time and doing school-based option where you're giving teachers the time to then have that training in the beginning or whatever part of the day, and to alter your school schedule. And that's a very individualized conversation that's not happening
01:20:20.125 --> 01:20:51.275
because we've been hearing this at least for the last four years. Um, and then the last thing, co-Op City, everybody knows co-Op City is my heart, right? I've been here every single year for the last six years talking about co-op city. Happy to vote yes for one year extension, but like the other contracts, like when we talk about our budget and how we're given something that already has to happen, whether we vote yes or no, and please vote yes because we have to keep moving.
01:20:51.305 --> 01:21:24.075
When do we stop the system to account for the students that we serve versus keeping it functioning to say that it's functioning and doing a job that it's supposed to do, but not doing it well. So I would love for us to yes to this so we can have hot heat right in the winter, but to have the conversation about what would it entail to upgrade to something modern that will function for all the schools on the campus. And I understand that there's a lot of concerns faced this, and these are great SLT conversations. Thank you.
01:21:25.085 --> 01:21:54.945
Thank you. Any other, okay, uh, chance? Uh, so I wanna thank everybody for their comments. Um, you know, this is the type of conversation that we enjoy having and really hearing your, your insight. And these are the things that we then take back to the table and we, we really give thought to as a team. And we have some of, we have our folks here who are ready to respond to some of these things. And so I'm going to ask, I know that we've, uh, communicated already. We have a number of people who are ready to respond. So if our team can respond, we have Deputy Chancellor Fody,
01:21:55.445 --> 01:22:26.495
we have Deputy Chancellor Hawkins. Um, if, if you two can come up and give some responses to some of what was raised here, one, um, I just wanted to quickly address Laura's question about preschool special education play placements. Laura, I did not look at the numbers today, but what I can tell you is that we're tracking them closely. We are up to date in terms of, uh, rolling giving. Um, we are both doing rolling openings and rolling, um, offers of seats. So, so far so good.
01:22:26.555 --> 01:22:59.845
We are preparing for another heavy lift in January of, of opening up, up the remaining bulk of the classrooms. But right now, kids are, we're are getting the seats that they need and, um, we're able to accommodate every, every child who needs one. Not, not a wait list, no, but every day another kid needs a placement, right? So it's, it's a moving target, but we're positioned to keep up with the movement. Thank you. Good evening. This is my first meeting, so happy to meet you.
01:22:59.845 --> 01:23:29.775
All right. Thank you. Um, d DC Hawkins. So wanting to respond your, your, your point as well around supports we're providing to our DEC support team, specifically our instructional coordinators and social workers. This one contract is just a one of many supports that we are providing to really build their muscles around family engagement strategies. However, there is a structure within the team where each of the social work and instructional quarters are actually on a team. It's called a pod under a leadership coach.
01:23:29.875 --> 01:23:55.015
They work in concert with them to provide direct coaching to leadership at the program level, but also coaching for the IC and social worker as well. We have asynchronous synchronous training that we provide, not just around clearly our curriculum literacy, family engagement strategies, but also those soft skills that they need to do the work long term. And we offer coursework and trainings that, that provide them CTLE and EU credits so they can continue their professional
01:23:55.155 --> 01:24:36.105
expertise, um, and their journey. So there is a host of, uh, supports training and coaching that we provide our staff in turn that they also provide our providers at CBOs district schools, pre-K centers, and all the settings that we provide early childhood programming in. Just to clarify, those ics are DOE staff, or those are contracted workers? They're DOE staff. You're welcome. Um, in terms of the questions raised about, or the comments and questions raised about DLT
01:24:36.105 --> 01:25:05.145
and Bard, um, again, uh, panel member e you and I have a long history and we've talked about this, um, in, in my previous roles as well. And so I look forward to working with Deputy Chancellor Rux, along with our, uh, executive, um, the director, uh, Dr. Melendez on how we can actually strengthen that work. And I know that that has started. We know that Sharon Reer and Dr. ux, um, had a, a really great, um, day of training, and I think we need to continue that kind of work. So I look forward to speaking with you
01:25:05.385 --> 01:25:36.615
and other panel members and others families and community members to seek their input. And Panel member Shepherd, I will be honest with you and say that we need to go back to the team and really look at what you're speaking of. I do not wanna speak from a place of ignorance, but thank you for raising that and, and we'll get back to you. Okay, great. Are there any other comments from panel members? Are we ready to proceed to question? Okay, let's, uh, proceed.
01:25:37.005 --> 01:26:11.645
Um, I just wanna respond to, I think member Ali's comment that, um, perhaps the vendor would be selling data. I just wanna clarify, um, uh, and that they release the data. So just to clarify, um, educational law 2D prohibits, um, let me just finish the statement and then you can respond. Um, that prohibits third party contracts from selling PII or disclosing it for commercial or marketing purposes, both, both the state law and the right state regulations that implement that. Um, we do make our vendors go through a data privacy review,
01:26:11.665 --> 01:26:47.965
but they cannot use it for marketing purposes under state law, right? Except it happened. Okay. Time. Yeah, go ahead. Okay. Thank you. I have a nuts and bolts question about what we're about to do here. Um, you know, and this really springs from actually an email you sent earlier this week, chair Buchner, uh, requesting the specific verbiage of a contract. Um, and I was alarmed to learn that what we're voting on are not contracts that exist. We're voting on pre contract pre contracts here.
01:26:47.965 --> 01:27:23.675
Could somebody please like, clarify this? Because yeah, we were unable to, you, y'all were unable to supply us with the actual language. We wanted the full specific contract of the full contract, not because of privacy or discretionary issues because it doesn't exist, um, yet. So I guess I've been under the perception that we've been voting on actual contracts, but it seems like we're voting on concepts of contracts. If somebody please, could, could correct me or clarify what exactly it is we're voting on here. Thank you. Mm-Hmm. Yep.
01:27:23.675 --> 01:28:07.195
Good evening. All right. I'll, uh, leave it to our chief procurement officer, Alicia Oui, if I get this right, 'cause I'm always not positioned well to be heard. Alicia Oui, chief Procurement Officer here at the DOE. Um, so the, the vote that, that you are going to render tonight is for us to move forward with a contract. So we're not allowed to move forward with the development of contracts without the panel's permission to move forward. So this is why the contract is not developed at the moment. There are steps in the process prior to us bringing items to the panel, uh, data privacy clearances on both the, uh,
01:28:07.695 --> 01:28:40.785
the technology side and on the legal side that has to occur, but nothing is finalized until after the panel votes on it. Does that answer your question? This is where the gist of what we're voting on here varies differently or, you know, from what isn't actually in the contracts. No. That, that would not occur. What we communicate and in terms of what's summarized in the, uh, request for authorization does not vary. We, we, we establish what those terms are prior to bringing it to panel,
01:28:41.805 --> 01:29:18.845
and we're not allowed to change it after the fact Clarification. I appreciate it. Okay. Any other questions? Yeah, Panel andia. So I have a question. A, a few weeks ago, maybe it was a month ago, so ago now, uh, we were discussing a contract that had to do with reading materials being available in other languages. And I'm wondering if there was so much pushback during that conversation, because there is not actually a way to negotiate that because the contract is written after the money has already been voted on.
01:29:19.145 --> 01:29:51.125
Okay, Sue, I I just wanna make a clarifying statement. Um, a majority of the contracts requirements contracts, right? So the contract value is not a guaranteed value, not in the case of requirements contracts. So we have a contract, I, I believe it was for assessments, and someone mentioned that we're, we're giving away $15 million. That's not the case. The vendors are being paid for services that are rendered. So there's no guarantee we have to establish estimates for contract value in order to enter into the contract.
01:29:51.125 --> 01:30:23.375
And, but it does not guarantee that these vendors are actually going to be rendered, uh, that amount of money. It's usually based on past spend, right? It's an estimate. And I know, Tom, you're gonna have your counter, because you always say, well, if it's based on, um, past, past spend and or historical spend, then that means we're going to pay. There's no guarantee of that, right? So just So, so what's, the contract is developed, how soon is it available to be seen the full contract?
01:30:23.375 --> 01:31:04.095
So, um, after panel there, there are a number of steps in the process that have to occur. It could take somewhere between two to three months for the contract to be finalized and registered with the controller. If, if the, if anyone from the public is looking or wants to see a, uh, a record of the contract, they would have to request it, um, through our legal team. I believe you would have to foil it. Any additional questions? I assume there might be. So any other que none? Oh, yes. Go back to, back to the data and privacy part of it.
01:31:04.215 --> 01:31:34.535
Because if we are contracted, you're not getting really, I think it's legal for you to Yeah. Yeah. I'm just gonna make a comment, um, about the privacy, right? There was one meeting that we had contracts about, we're doing, uh, business with a parent with the child, right? Not the parent. So this goes back to data and, uh, sharing data and information. So if we are not doing business with the parent company, but we are doing it with a child, I'm just gonna call it a child by one
01:31:34.795 --> 01:32:11.445
of the sub companies under the umbrella, our contract, we can tell them you can't share the data, blah, blah, blah. And we had this conversation that the parent company, we cannot tell what the parent company to do. So they still are sub going surround the law and sharing and sharing that data privacy. And as this agency, this is where people have issues with the data privacy law. Why don't we strengthen it? They're, you, you know who the parent company is. If you, if you wanna do business, you have to ensure you don't sell or share, uh, privacy.
01:32:11.645 --> 01:32:36.845
Or we go to someone else who will uphold it. I don't know why we always dealing with, oh, we are not dealing with the parent. We are dealing with this. So they only obligated that should not be. And I think that is a lot of the issues here. And that was what, um, parent member Ali say was saying, right? I could not, not say nothing, but that is what she going with, right? Because we may the child company not, may not be sharing it, and I'm sorry, I keep saying child,
01:32:37.865 --> 01:33:07.565
but the parent company is doing it. It should be liable. They should be held liable, even though they're not under contract. They're little, a company, the sub company is so they are sub they sub surround. I can't think of my, my vocabulary off today along with my voice, but, uh, they, they circumventing the system, you know, so that, that we need to strengthen. And I'm glad that we suspended the, that, that chancellor's regulations because it's not strong enough.
01:33:08.025 --> 01:33:41.445
We gotta make sure that the, the data and the privacy and the, and the meaning of the true contracts that we want is secure right? In, in all aspects. That's, I have to say that Legally the sub, the prime contractor will have to make sure that the subcontractor is compliant. The subcontractor must also comply. Um, you know, educational law 2D as well as the implementing regulations would not permit a vendor to circumvent the requirements by letting another party use the data and distribute the data. Okay.
01:33:41.545 --> 01:34:23.115
I remember ke are you waving information? Okay. Let, I think we're ready for the, for the vote on this. Um, yes. So Secretary, please call the roll. Uh, yes, I wanna note that there are no recusals on the proposed resolution. Uh, I will call the role if you want to vote differently on any particular items, please, uh, let me know when I call your name. Um, member Ali, please come back to me. Okay. Member Ali, say no on to yes on everything else. Um, member bin, No one to and yes to everything else.
01:34:25.415 --> 01:35:21.205
Um, member Katti No on, no on to, no on 14. And I would like to be recused from item 11. Oh, um, member Dean Stag. Yes. On all member fair. All member Garcia? Yes. Member Giordano. Yes. Across the board? Uh, vice Chair Green? Yes. Member Hassan? Yes. Member ho. Yes. To all member Es no. On two. Yes. To the rest Member. Lee?
01:35:22.375 --> 01:36:10.575
No. On two, abstain on eight. No. To 11 and 12. Hold on. No. To 11 and 12. Um, member Wyn? Yes. To all Member Ong? Yes. To all Member sap? Yes. To all Member Shepherd? No. To two, no to 14 abstain from 11 and 12. And yes. To the rest. Uh, member seat Sang Yes to all member Tora? Yes. To all, Uh, chair Faulkner? Uh, yes to all. And returning to Member Ali?
01:36:11.805 --> 01:37:57.205
Yes. To all Secretary Nathan? Yes. Um, I'm sorry. It was also abstained from number eight. Sorry. That's okay. So I have you no, on two and 14. Abstain on eight 11 and 12. Yes. Okay. Let me do the tallying. I do believe that they'll pass, but let me tally. Mm-Hmm. Right. Um, the resolution passes. Um, on item two there were 14 yeses and six nos.
01:37:57.465 --> 01:38:33.825
On item eight, there were 19 yeses and one abstention. On item 11, there were 17 yeses. Uh, two abstentions and a recusal. Item 12 had 19 yeses and one abstention. And item 14 had two nos and 18 yeses. Great. Okay. Thank you very much. First, I wanna just say that this was a, a great discussion. Um, and I think this is really what we wanna see here at the panel. Um, I want to thank the chancellor and I wanna thank the staff for, um, coming up
01:38:34.525 --> 01:39:03.945
and participating and really enriching that conversation. Um, I'd also like to speak to the folks around, I listen carefully around the issue of assessment. And I'm wondering whether the panel, and I'm looking at you, Tom Shepherd, um, whether this is something that the panel might want to be proactive and get involved in, and maybe we can create some kind of follow up. And I would also like to invite, um, some of the folks that are here in the audience that had specific concerns, you know, specific concerns. If we can find some way of engaging and,
01:39:03.945 --> 01:39:34.065
and see if we can create something that works a little bit better. 'cause what I'm hearing is there's a real feeling that it's not working in the way that it was intended to work. And if that's the case, then let's, let's put our heads together and see if we can come up with something that would, uh, work some, some pen of shepherd. Thank you Chair Harner. Um, I will say yes to that, right? And you, you're appointed. So, uh, now let's, let's, No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
01:39:34.465 --> 01:40:13.035
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll say yes to that. I will also say that it was raised in this conversation that the point behind this is that the people who make the decisions seem to be disconnected from the people that have to implement them. And No, no, I, I, the point here is the people that are tasked with implementing these things ought to be a part of, like a committee or anything that we put together to examine these assessments, how they work or don't work, and what appropriate solutions look
01:40:13.035 --> 01:41:05.675
Like. No, I, I, I absolutely agree with you. And I think we should start with some members of the public who were here, um, that offered some great commentary. And, um, and let's really see if there's a way that we can put our heads together. I think we have, you know, commitment from DOE that they've heard this and, uh, let's not leave here and then come back a year and then say, you know, here we, we, we missed an opportunity. Um, so I think there's an opportunity for us to put our heads together and collaborate.
01:41:06.975 --> 01:41:48.735
Um, just keeping in mind, uh, you know, as a panel member, being able to listen to what other parents and, and the decisions that need to be made across the five boroughs. Um, and it's a very particular situation to be able to sit back and here the, the opposition. So I think that will be a really great conversation to have because, um, this is one of the, you know, the contracts I'm not in agreement with. And it actually brings back pretty awful memories, um, of getting left back
01:41:49.475 --> 01:42:21.905
because I, I knew I wasn't a great tech test taker with the Regents exam, but I also knew that I was, um, you know, in what they called resource room. And I was so afraid to be stigmatized in the fifth grade that I actually just filled in the circles on a test I wanted to finish with everybody else. So I wouldn't, you know, you know, um, stand out in that way. And unfortunately, you know, I, that was the year that I was left back in the fifth grade. And then having to listen to parents
01:42:22.205 --> 01:42:55.865
who benefit from this assessment. So I think just if we can, if we can have this conversation with people that are really impacted by this contract, that'll be lovely. Some, something has to happen in the middle. Yep. We're gonna try to, uh, to see if we can have some, um, some, some impact in this area. So, um, yes, I'd, I'd like to recommend, um, potentially doing it focus group style so that we have different stakeholders present because there are at least 10%,
01:42:55.865 --> 01:43:24.865
and it could be more of students that most of this never works for and never will work for. And the stakeholders that are putting in the extra work, not only to prep for the exam, deliver the exam, proctor the exam score exams, but now they're differentiating, translating, interpreting. None of that is really like their job, right? Like they're supposed to be teaching kids not assessing. So focus group with different stakeholders to get a Sure. An a varied view of, of what our city really looks like and not few People. That's a great
01:43:24.925 --> 01:43:55.005
suggestion. I'm gonna leave it to the group to kind of figure out what the best way to facilitate so that, although it, it might be in terms of the contract that we just passed might be late. There may be other times and other contracts and other opportunities where this will come up and we'll have an opportunity to maybe have some, um, some sense of where we would like to see this, uh, move. Yeah. Yes. Panel member. I'll see it. I can't Contract isn't written yet. Since the contract isn't actually written yet.
01:43:55.005 --> 01:44:18.365
Can that focus group, especially with the teachers who are here tonight, take place before the contract is written and or finalized? Because it is, they're right. You just, we all right. I voted no, but we all just signed away five years. So I'm gonna suggest that you all, maybe just when this ends, we all kind of move some of the folks here and we get together and figure out what we Next steps. It's more of a question of is that possible? That's like a contract poss Like can they do that Logistically? I just, I
01:44:18.405 --> 01:44:53.585
don't wanna, I I would think, I mean, the chance's right there think it's possible. Yeah. Want you? No, yeah, I don't, uh, Judy, can you answer that question? Do you know if that's, or walking out? Oh, perfect. We have our general counsel here once this panel. Hello? Oh. Once the panel has voted to approve the substantive terms of the contract, what's left is negotiating standard provisions that really don't impact on the substance of the, um, matter itself, right?
01:44:53.615 --> 01:45:36.975
There's indemnification issues, there's our data agreements, there's stuff that really, if you read it in isolation, you would have no idea what it's connected to because it's, it's the part, it's a part of formalizing, um, the deal that your vote has just entered us into with the vendor. So no, we can't really stop the process. Two, um, I don't believe that the work that has to be done now to finalize a contract really speaks to the issues that members are raising. Yes. And this focus group, maybe, you know, assessments are important.
01:45:38.405 --> 01:46:13.335
We need a benchmark, right? Can we come up with different kinds of assessments that will reach different children? See the state, acknowledge the regions as a exit exam. Exam is not good for everyone. So they have multiple pathways now. They, they, they're working on creating multiple pathways to graduate, right? High school measurements, right? And one of them is to get rid of, one of the suggestions is to get rid of the three diplomas that only have one. And then you can have seals,
01:46:13.445 --> 01:46:50.245
but then multiple, if you don't want to take the regents, they're creating other pathways for students to graduate again. 'cause we know that all students are not the greatest test. They may, they may know the, the subject brilliantly, but then for when it comes to a test, they freeze up or they can't, it doesn't translate on paper, let alone on a computer. Right? So maybe we should come up with sta you know, different assessments for different students. So to help to give a better understanding of that. And again, we should like kind of minimize.
01:46:50.715 --> 01:47:20.685
And then also, so all stakeholders understand what is the reasoning and purposes of these assessments could create an assessment is to look for every single thing that you want, and then also make sure that the teachers can see this is their strengths, this is their weakness. But I know they create tests to show that, okay, in math you are, you're weak in word problems. It might be a lit literacy 'cause you're not understanding what the question, the question is asking, right?
01:47:20.785 --> 01:47:53.205
You are strong in, in, um, using the formulas. But do you know when to use the formulas? If we're gonna create assessments and teachers feel that, you know, it is worth their time, they gotta be make sure they know how, how they would further as help them assess their child right at the school level. Because not a lot of that issue is there. We know that assessments is needed to get overall sense of the city, the district, et cetera. But if we're gonna give these assessments list, um, the teachers minimize the amount, first of all,
01:47:53.505 --> 01:48:23.575
and then show them how they can use that data. And some of them, I'm pretty sure know they can use the data, right? If they see the breakdown of what their child is, but the, their ch your, their students are doing, because I'm I, the tests that I believe that they give their, their children help them to know which contact area they're weak or strong, but maybe I don't know how the assessments are showing that at the school level for their child. I don't know if they actually even showing that, because at least they will see that, oh,
01:48:23.915 --> 01:48:59.645
I can use help, use help assess. But if they're just assessing so somewhere else, use the data that is not conducive to the learning environment. Chancellor. So I wanna thank everybody for this very intense and informative conversation around assessment. And we're not trying to avoid the topic, obviously. We're here listening and we're taking notes as a team. What I do wanna offer is an opportunity for our team to brief the panel. I understand, um, that the focus group suggestion, I think it's an excellent idea.
01:49:00.145 --> 01:49:35.485
Our team is also holding our own focus groups and doing our own listening sessions around the city. And those are kicking off very shortly. But what I will say is we welcome any opportunity for topics that are taking this amount of time, not because we don't wanna listen here, but because we would love to spend time with you briefing you on just this topic. So I'm asking the panel to consider accepting that invitation. So our team can give you a robust briefing on how assessments can be selected at the school level,
01:49:35.485 --> 01:50:11.825
the role that school leaders have in assessments, the role that superintendents and the role that Central has. And of course, hearing our teachers on how we can strengthen our systems of assessments and what can be done at the teacher level. That sounds great. I think, I think we're in agreement. Yes. Panel member, I, I have a concern about like the, the trend of the five year contracts in general. Because if, if we're always only presented with this five year option, if we want something different, we have to ask for that.
01:50:11.825 --> 01:50:42.385
We, the landscape changes too quickly for us to commit to five years to anybody for anything, you know? And so like, kids don't even spend five years in a school unless it's elementary and that's six years, and then it's three years and four years unless you're in district 75 and none of this works for those students. So like, we're not gonna do that, right? Mm-Hmm. So how, how do we, I would like to ask to see one in two year contracts going forward so that when people make a comment, and because right, sometimes comment comes
01:50:42.405 --> 01:51:11.195
after certain things where the conversation then leads to a point where there's like a different understanding and there is, as you said, no mechanism to go back. But if the contract was only one or two years, we wouldn't be committed to a decision that nobody really liked. There are people that voted yes that said they didn't like it. And, and that's problematic. So how do we then make this like for the kids, because that's a, a company thing. That's a business thing. That's a,
01:51:11.615 --> 01:51:38.915
we don't wanna revisit this for another five years. We as a company don't wanna redo a contract. We don't wanna negotiate again, because all that takes time and payroll. That doesn't matter because that doesn't serve our students. So that topic, I'm gonna refer to the contract committee to address that. What, what the practicality of that is. Uh, that actually is a misnomer. We do have a contract committee. Um, the information that was put that we got rid the, we, what we did is we changed the requirement that it had
01:51:39.585 --> 01:52:13.065
to be meet in person because it was only, there were only three people that regularly attended and there was a call. So we still have a contract committee. We have a very able contract committee chair. Thank you. Um, yes. Panel member lie and then panel member Casre. And then we're gonna move on to the public comment. Oh, I'm so sorry, chief. I just clarify. Yeah. What are we talking about? Okay. Are we talking about the same meeting? No, I think we were talking about the length of contracts. That's the portion I was directing.
01:52:13.245 --> 01:52:40.065
It wasn't, it was a general comment about contracts, but specifically talking about the assessment contract, that was the five year proposal and asking if we can see one or two year proposals in the future. Yeah. Right. Because the landscape changes in five years. If we don't like it now in two years, we're probably gonna hate it. Right. So I heard what you said. Is this a part of The, it's a bigger con it's a bigger issue around contracting and, and length of contracts. So I've expanded it in that. Okay. I'm, I'm talking specifically about, um,
01:52:40.125 --> 01:53:05.085
getting together and talking about, um, uh, the assessments and stuff like that. Is that a part of this conversation? No. Separate things. I Used it as an Example. As an example. Yeah. So like as an example, we have this five year assessment contract. Yeah. Could we, we already voted on it, so there's no way, as he said to like the general counsel said, there's no way of like amending or reversing that. But going forward we shouldn't see five year contract. Right? Yeah.
01:53:05.085 --> 01:53:32.205
Okay. The bigger issue, I Don't necessarily agree to, she didn't Have five year contracts. Folks. Both please wait to be recognized. Okay. The next person. Yeah. Then we're gonna public comment. Um, Pamela Maretti and then Pamela. And then we're going to thank you Pam. Oh, we'll let you speak and then we'll move into public comment. Oh, Chancellor Ramos. I, I am just curious regarding the screeners, um, uh, the, the way that they're rolled out where Central
01:53:32.265 --> 01:54:04.125
is sort of like holding them and then the schools can, uh, have them distributed. Is, is there like a chance that, that, that pathway would change similar to the way the computers went, where the schools would then just Central would negotiate the contract and the schools would decide whether they want to do the screeners or not? Like, is that sort of where we're go going ultimately? Like right now, the schools are mandated to do the screeners, but is there, is there a chance
01:54:04.125 --> 01:54:35.325
that it'll turn into something where the schools get to just choose whether they wanna use those screeners? Panel member? I, I really thank you for the question, but I'm going to respectfully ask if I can regroup with my team and if we can make that part of the follow up in the briefing. Thank you. Okay. Lie, Uh, thank you Chair. I just wanted to address the idea, uh, two ideas. One that there's no going back once you, the contract has been voted on and you can't do anything for five years. And the idea that we're having the focus group
01:54:35.945 --> 01:55:13.445
after the panel voted on the contract. Um, I, but I but the clar no. The clarification I wanna provide though is something that was recently mentioned to the panel, um, and that in baked into every DOE contract is the ability for DOE to cancel the contract for any reason. Is that right? I just wanna confirm that. That's right. And so if there is a change in policy or if there is a change based on input, um, from folks, there is the ability of DOE to pivot on a contract even after the contract has been passed by pep, even
01:55:13.505 --> 01:55:46.445
after it's been registered from by the comptroller's office. So I just wanna clarify that, and I'm hoping I'm correct about that. I see Alicia, yeah, I, I I think the issue, Yeah. Are there any additional comments? We're gonna move on now to public comment. Um, section of the meeting. Um, let me just sort of re remind everyone of the rules of, um, public comment, um, during tonight's public comment, we'll again, be calling speakers up in groups. Secretary Nathan will call people up, uh, to speak.
01:55:46.945 --> 01:56:15.205
Um, we're gonna begin first with students. And I know there was a student here, Earl, that wanted to speak earlier. We'll begin with students education council members and elected officials, followed by members of the general public during open comment. Each individual that is signed up to speak, we'll be allot up to two minutes. Um, I would like to remind speakers to refrain from, um, use of harsh language. I know sometimes these discussions become pretty, um, emotional so that, um, we just need to refrain from that.
01:56:15.205 --> 01:56:54.075
So at this point, I'd like to ask, uh, secretary Nathan, if you could please call the names up for public comment. And can I ask everybody? Please come to order. Do we have the room? Please come to order. So, uh, there was a student who had signed up, um, Lila Torres, if you're here, um, the green. So I don't know, I will call, um, people who signed up under the education council name. Uh, is there Lila? Is that student? I think that is maybe, oh, no, no, no, no. Okay. Um,
01:56:54.615 --> 01:57:42.255
wait a minute. That's, that's, these are, um, I'll call up while we're waiting, I think for our student speaker, Dr. Miriam, Ben Ellis, Craig Slutkin, Gavin Healy, and Dr. Darling Meme. And please state your name before you begin speaking. Thank you. I was told I was number two. Good evening, everyone. My name is Dr. Mim Ben Shake Ellis, um, CC 13 Brooklyn. So I'm here to share with everyone, uh,
01:57:44.935 --> 01:58:20.655
an issue about PSL, public School Athletic league, So PSL and the opportunities for sports for all our students in NYC public schools. I have many points, and I really wish not to be interrupted. Parents and families do not know about sports opportunities in their kids. Incoming high school parents and families are not aware of the multiple deadlines for applying to the three season sports fall, winter and spring that PSL offers to our 1800 NYC schools.
01:58:20.675 --> 01:58:54.415
And of course, I'm talking only about the high schools and the middle schools, but the most important thing is the high schools. When parents realized that PSL missed, uh, the PSL missed deadline and opportunities, they direct their request to their superintendent's office. The superintendent's office replies to these families and parents that they cannot overrule any PSL decision or decisions. PSL executives respond to parents because the parents are persistent
01:58:54.605 --> 01:59:30.955
and they find the numbers of PSL. It's public knowledge on the website. So, PSL executive respond to the parents and families and guardians that no communication with their office or staff should happen, and PSL direct families to their principal and athletic directors. If the latter ad athletic director does exist in their school, PSL does not accept any help in students' assignment to other neighboring schools if there are no teams or less than six teams in the freshman high school or,
01:59:32.945 --> 02:00:15.405
or the high school of the student. I hope you're following with me right now. Thank You. Your time is elapsed. Can I just finish this? PSL assert that other DOE offices are only their partner and cannot help correct or adjust any PSL assignment. I just wanna speak about the Student. Okay. No, I'm sorry. Your time has expired. If you could give us, you could provide us a statement afterwards
02:00:25.965 --> 02:01:09.705
And I understand, but your time has expired and I, And we have, we do. Yeah. Yes, we do have a response. And, and I thank you. I thank you for your comment. We do have our chief who oversees PSAL here, mark Rampant. We'd like an opportunity to respond. Thank you so much. I'm gonna talk to this parent individually about the respect, um, the confusion as it relates to deadlines and so forth. Many people believe that the PSAL directly oversees what happens at the schools young people.
02:01:10.285 --> 02:01:48.045
So just, I'm gonna paint a picture for you. The PSAL provides the funding to the schools. Each one of our schools hires an athletic director, um, AP phys, a AP who is in charge of the coaches per sec. We pay the procession for those, um, athletic directors, right? And they hire the coaches. Each one of the coaches has a tryout. There is a start and an end to the tryout process. I'm gonna talk to this parent to get, get clarity as it relates to the PSA's responsibility versus the school's responsibility.
02:01:48.115 --> 02:02:21.085
PSAL doesn't oversee exactly what is happening at the school level. We provide procession opportunities who, for those who are chosen by the principals, in order to ensure that they are in full compliance, while they are in fact rules and regulations, the, the selection of teams, the selection of team members of that, of the individual schools, all of that information is publicized. It is open book. One of the things that we are doing in the PSAL is creating greater transparency so that folks have a greater understanding
02:02:21.305 --> 02:02:58.855
of this entire mammoth of a process for our public schools athletically. I'm gonna talk to this parent and get specifics and put her in touch with the executive director for the PSAL so that we gain full, um, overall clarity. And if there are areas where parents are not understanding, I can assure you that we will make that clear for parents going forward. Right? Thank you. We have the next speaker, um, I, it, Craig Slutkin, Gavin Healy or Dr. Darling Remy. Okay. Yeah. I was told I was number two on list when I signed.
02:02:58.955 --> 02:03:29.025
I started with, we went from student to education council members. I will now go back to the top of the list and call, um, other speakers. Uh, I'm Dr. D. Member of CC three. I don't know if it's my right, my time right now That Dr. Meme. Yes. Yes. Alright. Thank you so much. Good evening everyone. Um, and happy to be here. And, uh, I would like to remind that we have the polish, uh, heritage month.
02:03:29.025 --> 02:04:06.815
And this time I'm coming here again on behalf of Polish community. Uh, we request, uh, many times in, uh, district three, district 24 CCLL pass resolution to support change of regulation, council regulation as six three to enlarge number of communications languages, permanent communication, but DOE to the, uh, community. Uh, as you know, New York State speak 12 languages, DOE, only nine permanent languages. And it's, again, Polish is missing. Italian is missing, it is missing.
02:04:06.815 --> 02:04:45.435
I mean, uh, I don't know how other communities but the Polish community really need to support because what's happened today, what hit me today that the principal of only one Brooklyn, uh, bilingual school tell the parents that the closing program, how it's possible, it was hard to build this program. And he's easy to say, oh, me and superintendent and director of, uh, a multilingual, uh, department, we decide to close it. Not talking to parents, not talking to SLT even. So how it's possible, it's possible
02:04:46.555 --> 02:05:19.555
because parents don't know even because DOE not communicate in Polish language to polish parents, that they have chance to put the students through great bilingual program. And again, same situation is in different languages in different companies. I'm really support if you want to provide you with materials, but we need support from phase to talk to parents. Alright, so thank you so much. Have a great evening and please, let's continue this conversation.
02:05:19.655 --> 02:06:12.165
Thank you. Thank, I'll call the next group of speakers. Um, some people, I'm going to have to just use the first part of their email address, um, to call them up. So the first speaker is mishmash Kella. Oh, is, um, Lala Torres here. Okay, please. Sorry. Of course. Hello everyone. Hope you're having a great day. I'm here on behalf of students who don't have a bus and don't like school lunch. Okay. Um, first, not a lot of kids like school lunch, and there's a reason why.
02:06:12.585 --> 02:06:43.155
So the fruits are typically frozen, pretty much unedible. Um, I've had an experience where I've had moldy food. I bet other kids have two. Um, one time I went to go talk to a teacher about it and he said, okay, then just don't eat it. Some kids don't get sent with lunches. Maybe their parents can't afford it or they just don't have it. The kids should be able to eat the school's lunch that the parents tax dollars pay for. And I propose there should be another food taste testing for the kids.
02:06:43.155 --> 02:07:13.635
And I think maybe the parents should be able to taste the food or the kitchen staff, the food that they're making, that the kids don't like. And yeah. Um, so school buses. I don't have a school bus. I don't have an IEP and I'm two blocks outta the district. I live about two miles away from the school, 20 minutes away. And I don't have a bus. Um, I used to have a bus because my brother had an IEP. I don't anymore because he graduated and he's two years older than me.
02:07:14.135 --> 02:07:56.045
Um, I might go into middle school without a bus and my parents spend maybe a hundred dollars a month on just maybe four or five cats because they're like $20. Um, it's unfair how I had a bus and then when my brother graduated, I didn't have one. So I propose kids who already had a bus or some, or like even had a bus at one point for whatever reason, should be able to keep their bus until they graduate. And they should be able to extend the distance that kids can have a bus at, because two blocks outta the district is not that much. Um, I Thank you. Hope y'all have a great night.
02:08:03.685 --> 02:08:42.855
Happy birthday memory schedule. We have other speakers. Any other Speakers? We do have other speakers. Yes. So the first speaker, again, the email part, the before the email was mishmosh. K. Um, then we have Leoni Hamson, then ea Gelman, um, David dama and ga, sorry, excuse me on the pronunciation. G-A-L-I-N-A-U-A-U. Um, you ready? Yes.
02:08:43.235 --> 02:09:15.915
Please say your name so we know who's speaking. My name is Dright and I'm gonna be introducing several parents who will share their children's experiences at Beacon High School and discuss the profound failure in leadership by principal Johnny Ventura and the assistant principal of Special Ed Naisha Bailey. Their shocking inability to achieve even the most basic standards of compliance program coherence and communication, and how these issues are impacting the broader school community at Beacon High School
02:09:15.915 --> 02:09:57.825
and the students, particularly IEP students. Overall wellbeing. At this time, I yield my time to the next speaker from Beacon. No, well still two minutes. Okay. Good evening. Sign Up. Yeah, I know. I'm here tonight to read the following statement On behalf of another Beacon parent, dear members of the panel and senior leadership, I am a beacon parent and a career educator with deep knowledge of what it takes to make and sustain high quality schools. Within the DOEI have been listening to
02:09:57.965 --> 02:10:41.675
and supporting students, staff, and families. As we attempt to save Beacon Under Principal Ventura, we have experienced incompetent leadership that is unwilling to do what it takes to make a great school, school administration that dismisses the concerns of all constituents and speaks in vague generalities or blatantly ignores them the dangers of toxic fumes, student bomb and shooting threats and threats made pointedly against blacks and Jews, Serious violations of students' rights to a free
02:10:42.175 --> 02:11:28.885
and appropriate public education that cause students to fail for classes, actions that violate numerous chancellor's regulations, New York State and federal laws, including the individuals with Disabilities Education Act, et cetera, racism, antisemitism, Islamophobia, and a lack of safety for LGBTQ plus students. Significantly declining staff morale and arts and special programs being cut or eliminated. Thank you for your comments. Um, the next speaker, whose name I read? Yes. Hi. Thank you. I'm Amaya Gelman.
02:11:29.025 --> 02:12:03.725
I'm reading for Beacon parents who are anonymous for fear of retribution. In four years as AP for special ed, Naisha Beatty hasn't provided a basic safety net for vulnerable students. Beacon's IEP satisfaction is at 48% the lowest of all DOE high schools by almost 12%. Meanwhile, interim principal of interim background, it does a guidance counselor and AP for special ed at Brooklyn Tech, where he was named in an OCR complaint by special ed families. Last third quarter,
02:12:03.785 --> 02:12:39.115
beacon special ed students had about a 54% failure rate for 10th grade geometry, ninth grade algebra. It was 46% ninth grade bio 42% 11th grade math 54%. We got this data through Superintendent Chang's office because the administration refused to provide it. Ventura is unwilling or unable to engage teachers, students, and parents, or look at actual data to understand school needs and make meaningful change. In June, deputy Chancellor Rux was made aware of special ed issues and given 208 pages of FAPE violations, she decided more coaching was the answer.
02:12:39.135 --> 02:13:12.345
There are now at least six advisors on site. In addition to the five from last year, our children get no such support. This fall, Mr. Ventura grossly misrepresented well-researched parent grading policy recommendations suggesting that parents want a grade inflation. He pitted us against teachers resulting in UFT complaints. Course contracts are still waiting. The CEP is overdue. Parents have stepped in to develop a CEP grounded in data that responds to actual needs. Students gave personal attention and support a rating of 56%.
02:13:12.345 --> 02:13:42.205
Even so, special ed teachers were just stripped of their advisories and tutoring teaching teams completely reshuffled so that ICT practices were lost Special ed teachers assigned to new subjects. Many students say that now their special ed teachers aren't familiar enough with their subjects to help them. I'll say one more thing. Uh, Ventura has no classroom or curriculum experience. He came in completely unfamiliar with the consortium model. He's never held an invo session with parents describing our school's PE pedagogy, presumably
02:13:42.665 --> 02:14:31.105
because he can't DOE is prioritizing and experienced administrators over the welfare of our children. Thank you. Thank you. Are you one of the speakers who signed up? I signed up. Yeah. I can't hear you. Okay, then please speak. My name is Lenny Hamson and I co-chair the Parent Coalition for Student Privacy. We let the fight for stronger student privacy law and the legislature listened and passed a new law called Education 2D in 2014. Updating the chancellor's regulations on student privacy was
02:14:31.105 --> 02:15:05.945
long overdue and hadn't been done for 16 years, especially as there's been an explosion of data sharing by DOE, including with more than 500 ed tech companies. The need for stronger privacy protections was also shown by the recent Illuminate and MoveIt breaches, which exposed the personal data of over 1 million current and former New York City students. Yet instead of strengthening privacy protections, the proposed chancellors regulations would significantly weakened them by saying that a huge and unlimited range of personal student data, including their names, phone numbers, emails,
02:15:06.045 --> 02:15:42.545
home addresses, birth dates, photos and more could be shared with anyone DOE likes without parental consent and without any of the privacy protections required by the state law to the chancellor. We urge you to listen to parents and privacy advocates who sent over 3000 emails to you and PEP members urging you to require parental consent and a written agreement to protect any personal student data that is shared with any third parties not contracted to provide specific services to schools. And that you require that all school medical
02:15:42.685 --> 02:16:15.865
and mental health records be afforded at least as strong privacy protections as other student records. And that the most rigorous security must be mandated to protect against breaches and the misuse of student data In general. We need the DOE to show far more concern and commitment towards protecting the privacy and safety of New York City students. We also ask that you or your staff meet with us along with other advocates and parents as soon as possible to ensure the privacy and safety of New York City students.
02:16:16.175 --> 02:16:52.225
I'm also concerned what I heard from pe PEP members tonight, that they did not receive the 3000 emails that were sent to them. Um, many of them said they received none at all, which is extremely concerning and makes me worry that DOE is somehow blocking those Messages from the public. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Um, there's a speaker, David dama or Gala now. Uh, good afternoon. I would like to say that Mass Department
02:16:52.305 --> 02:17:23.385
of Beacon High School is not complying with our school's grad policy and philosophy and current administration of the school is not able to fix the problem. I'm the parent of the 10th grader, uh, who has an ip. And my child has struggled at this school since the beginning. We came to begin as a consortium school that should be able to, uh, evaluate the different ways in which a child learns and beacon, particularly math classes, uh, very heavily weighted on, uh, by test in order to assess chi uh, students.
02:17:23.565 --> 02:17:58.225
My child is not a good test taker and that's why we chose a consortium school in first place in Nans Gray, she was assigned to a math ICT class with a general ed teacher unsympathetic to special learners. The teacher didn't understand my child or what her challenges were. She didn't believe she struggled with tests in, um, in the teacher's class. The grade was based 70% on tests, uh, with no opportunity for retakes or any grade improvement in student fails to test. We would work so hard and a lot to prepare her
02:17:58.885 --> 02:18:33.345
or my child for tests and she would fail and the teacher would never let her retake, of course. And the general education teacher started to ignore my emails, eventually send a generic, uh, email informing my child was failing. Now, uh, instead of mastering the material, the priority became attempting to pass the test via any means available. And my child's IEP lists anxiety over the test and their refusal to provide recommendation recommendations at Beacon has severely impacted my child's mental state self confidence.
02:18:33.805 --> 02:19:09.785
And her, uh, anxiety was worsened. Uh, her middle school was a consortium school, which allowed retakes and it was never a problem before. But then my child came to Beacon and everything changed. Uh, and this year the story repeats itself. Test 70% of the grade, no retakes. I don't mind if you test as one of many other ways to assess my child, maybe 20, 25% of the grade, but to have the bulk of the grade based on test with no opportunity for retakes. Uh, with such policies, these teachers are sentencing my child to fail
02:19:10.435 --> 02:19:52.495
and no one is able to, uh, fix the problem. Thank you. The next group of speakers is Jean Ween, um, Eve Smith, Paul Joseph, and Mattis Berger. If you could make your way to the microphone, Um, over there. And I'm one of the Beacon parents who also signed up to speak, but I don't hear my name being Called. Um, I'm going down the list All right. As I see it. So, alright. There are still some other names to call, uh, Gman.
02:19:52.615 --> 02:20:23.015
Yes. Thank you. Thank you. Um, hello, my name is Gwen. I am the program director of CAN International. We hope to connect with schools and organizations that could benefit from our support. Canada International is a nonprofit dedicated to helping first generation college bound students navigate a school application process, preparing them with my mentors for college students and professionals across various fields. We have our 100 active mentors and most of them are graduates of New York City public schools.
02:20:23.015 --> 02:20:57.335
I am a proud CUNY graduate and a New York City public school system and a parent who raised white children in the same system. I am deeply committed to the mission and my experience on the advisory board of high schools. And CUNY fuels my passion for empowering these students. For the past three years, we've worked with schools, schools in Brooklyn, Manhattan, and we are currently in our fourth cohort. Any guidance from the board and panel on how we can better connect with schools in the system to provide mentorship
02:20:57.465 --> 02:21:37.435
and support for first generation college students would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your time. Thank you. Um, is Eve Smith, Paul Joseph, or Mattis Berger as the next speakers? I have a quick question 'cause I was allotted a minute 20, so if I could just have 40 seconds to finish. Are you, did you sign up to be a speaker? I'm Eve Smith. You're Eve Smith? Yes. Oh, oh, so she someone else referred to her so she can speak.
02:21:38.975 --> 02:22:19.245
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Thank you. So, just continuing this statement, on behalf of the other person from the other parent from Beacon, many of us are losing faith in this system and wonder why we are at Beacon. Even with the support of Superintendent Chang's staff for over a year, Mr. Ventura has failed to address fundamental challenges and has been unable to inspire key stakeholders that the school is moving in the right direction. The recent 2324 New York City School survey dashboard shows that Beacon is dying.
02:22:20.155 --> 02:23:04.465
Nearly every category is red. You know, this means that interim acting Principal Ventura, it's failing the students, students and staff in his care. We are watching Beacon's demise and we feel trapped. There is so much special about this school. It has good bones and can still be healed. Expert teachers on staff have a deep understanding of and commitment to consortium equity and culturally responsive pedagogy. They will not stay forever. If this continues, we cannot all speak directly to those in power for fear of retaliation, we have lot
02:23:05.085 --> 02:23:47.215
to lose and we have already lost too much. But we are here, we are watching and we are begging you to step in. Thank you. Thank Paul Joseph or Matts Berger. Uh, good evening Panel for educational policy and a Chancellor of Vz Ramos. Uh, thank you for giving me the time tonight to speak. Uh, my name is Paul Joseph, and I'm an ELA teacher at a transfer school at Brooklyn High School for Leadership and Community Service. One of about 50 transfer schools, uh, throughout New York.
02:23:47.535 --> 02:24:20.215
Um, on October 7th, um, superintendent, um, Jonathan Sullivan announced that he was submitting our name, um, to be closed, uh, at the end of this term. And, um, so that catapulted me to be here this evening, speaking to you. And, um, in, in, in the minute and 25 seconds I have left, there's really two things that I wanna accomplish. And, and the first one is, is to just point out the complete, I guess, cognitive dissonance and complete, uh, kind of confusion and puzzlement that exists when you have
02:24:20.675 --> 02:24:52.165
two narratives about the same place that are so divergent. And on one hand, we're failing school, and, and even though there were 62 schools on the state receivership list and the 60 were removed and all remaining, only us and one other student, um, it would look like a failing school. But on the other hand, we have this really vital, really, really experienced, uh, school that is responding relevantly to our families and students. And we have so many good things happening. So, um, I just, it it puzzles me
02:24:52.625 --> 02:25:29.025
to live with that dissonance. Um, the last thing that I would like to do is I would, I, I, I really would love to have some of you come out to see our school on 300 Willoughby Avenue in Bedstuy. I I know that you're very, very, very busy, but if some of you can make some time to come see what we do, I think you will come to the same conclusion that it is worth saving this school. Um, and so I please invite you, and again, I thank you for your time this evening. Thank you. Thank you.
02:25:29.045 --> 02:26:08.785
Good evening. Uh, my name is Mattai Lindberger. I'm the school social worker at the Brooklyn High School of Leadership and Community Service. Um, I have been there since 2012. I started out as a special education teacher, um, and then transitioned into the role of school social Worker, um, for years ago. Um, as my, uh, colleague, um, Mr. Joseph explained, we, uh, were recently told that our school is, um, scheduled or, or proposed to be closed. Uh, and the reason, uh, for that was, um, basically bad attendance, um, data,
02:26:09.845 --> 02:26:43.185
uh, on, uh, on regents passing, um, and, uh, and graduation rates. So, um, I believe that we've made tremendous progress in those, uh, those respects. Our, our, um, graduation rate actually is significantly higher than the transfer school average, uh, at 60, uh, 7%. Um, we graduated 60 students just last year between January and, uh, and August of this year. Uh, we graduated 60 students. We're a small school. Uh, so that's about 30% of our, our student population
02:26:43.185 --> 02:27:16.755
that was able to graduate last year with a high school diploma, uh, which is not nothing. Um, I also believe that, you know, the numbers don't tell the whole story. Um, we, we, um, we provide much more to our students than just classroom instruction. A lot of our students, um, come in with, you know, just being our, their, their third or fourth school, um, having, uh, uh, significant barriers to coming to school at home. Um, a lot of our students struggle with, uh, mental health issues, depression, anxiety, uh, uh,
02:27:17.175 --> 02:27:44.605
housing insecurity, food insecurity, and all these become barriers to attendance. And we work around that. We engage with all of our students, uh, even those that don't show up every day, uh, through ELT, through outreach. Um, and, and, and many more, um, ways that we connect with our students. Uh, like my co uh, co uh, coworkers said we'd love to invite you guys and see what we're doing at leadership. And I know my time is up. Thank You. Thank you.
02:27:46.555 --> 02:28:24.885
And the next, the next group of speakers, Dan Bright, Michelle Baptist, Alexandra Opolis, Ellen Chu, and Christina Collins. Okay. So, um, my name is Dan Bright. I'm, uh, very dissatisfied and soon to be former, uh, customer at Beacon High School. Um, I'm asked to come here by other parents who don't wanna speak publicly 'cause they're scared of retaliation by the schools, uh, administration and by teachers. So my son is a freshman.
02:28:24.945 --> 02:28:54.605
We've been there just under two months, and thank God I just got a, a guidance transfer, uh, request approved to get him out of that school and into another school beginning Monday. I'm gonna just read to you an email, uh, that I sent to Crystal Davis two days ago. Uh, she's the Director of Special Education in the office of superintendent Alan Chang. I just wrote to her because I had dealt with her once before about something. She was the only person I could think of to try to help us with this.
02:28:54.625 --> 02:29:25.405
So dear Ms. Davis, our son's treatment at Beacon High School has deteriorated rapidly since we last communicated. He's being bullied by teachers. His IEP requirements are being violated by teachers on a daily basis. Despite our repeated requests to teachers and administrators to comply with the IEP mandates. And he's now experiencing anxiety that we believe is going to lead to a very serious mental health crisis. We do not get him to another school immediately. Last week, I went to the Family Welcome Center at 3 33 seventh Avenue
02:29:25.545 --> 02:29:57.905
and requested an immediate transfer to the Academy for Careers in television and film. We urgently request that you do whatever you can to get this transfer approved right away. The IEP violations that have been ongoing since the beginning of the school year include one requiring my son to write answers to test questions by hand, despite the fact that his IEP mandates, he'd be permitted to use assistive technology, EG typed answers on his laptop or dictate answers orally using voice to text software. Two, refusing to reduce the quantity of homework he is given
02:29:57.905 --> 02:30:27.105
three, refusing to let him hand in homework late without a penalty with some teachers giving him a zero if he tries to hand in homework a day late. And his IEP says he shouldn't be penalized for handing in homework late, not reducing the number of questions on quizzes, and then failing him because he can't complete the number they've given him, which are well beyond his neurological capacities, and it's in his IEP. And they refuse to modify or do anything they're required to. We've talked to the principal, we've talked to the AP
02:30:27.105 --> 02:30:54.625
for special ed, we've talked to the teachers. They just ignore us. They do nothing. They're the most incompetent people we've ever seen in our lives. My wife works at another high school for nearly 20 years as an SLP, and she's absolutely shocked at the low quality of the teaching. The, the rudeness and lack of respect from a lot of the teachers, from the administrators. None of these people would last a few months at her school. And I've been hearing about her school for almost 20 years. And what happens there when a new, when, when,
02:30:54.805 --> 02:31:37.235
when a teacher is causing trouble or when an AP isn't performing. Thank you. They get it. They get rid of them. You need to clean that place up. Thank you. Uh, beacons, families and staff, thank you for your comments and your input and to, uh, Brooklyn Leadership. Thank you so much. I just wanna clarify something that, uh, we are in early stages of engagement. A decision has not been made about closure. So I just wanna, I wanna make that point. Uh, and thank you for the invitation.
02:31:38.625 --> 02:32:12.745
High school early. Um, the next Michelle Baptist, Alexandra Opolis, Ellen McCue, or Christina Collins. Hi, uh, thank you to the panel for your time this evening. Um, we wanna say first, welcome to the new Chancellor Ramos. We're very happy to have you. Um, I'm a teacher at a consortium high school and Chancellor Ramos. I really hope that we can begin to ease the relationship between the consortium and the DOE. It's been a rough ride so far with the Adams administration, and we really look forward to your, um, encouragement
02:32:12.775 --> 02:32:43.145
of the type of learning and assessment that we do. Project-based learning, culturally responsive learning, um, curriculum rather. Um, you've heard tonight about how, uh, ill-equipped these, um, sort of pre-programmed assessments are to truly get to know our students. And that's the type of, that's the opposite of the type of learning that we try to do in the consortium model. Um, teachers are best equipped to assess their students, not computers, um, in regards to these contracts. I'd also like to pose a question. Why are we signing contracts
02:32:43.815 --> 02:33:19.975
for longer than the mayor's term limits? Mayoral control leads to a very chaotic system on the ground floor in the DOE, um, and extending these contracts for such long times, do nothing to help it. Um, I'd also like to say that I hope one of the first things this new administration does is reinstate Taj Sutton as CEC 14 president, as you did with the racist homophobic CET two President, whose groups have recently been founded to be funded by Na Nazi enthusiast, Harlan Crow, Republican hedge fund billionaire, such as Joseph Derman,
02:33:19.975 --> 02:34:01.255
Dan Loeb, Paul Singer, and the list goes on. These hyper conservatives have no place putting their money in the DOE and shame on the DOE for reinstating this type of depravity or depravity, and continuing to sign light, the much needed leadership of Taj Sutton in d and CEC 14. Now I yield the rest of my time. Thank you. Next speaker, please. Oh, I'll take a shot. Yeah. My name is Ellen McQue and I am along with Shirley Bin, a recovering Mets fan, but
02:34:01.255 --> 02:34:43.275
I'm also, I am also the parent of a deaf, uh, deaf person, an adult who went through the New York City public school system successfully. I am also hearing an oral, so I have my feet in both worlds over, over the summer. It's come to my attention and it's a small world, even though I have big feet. But the, over the summer, it's come to our attention that three students at a non-public school had their hearing education services aborted, um, by the Department of Ed. The people were given a short amount of time
02:34:43.575 --> 02:35:18.655
to get what's called a related service provider. The related service provider was not available. This is not the first and only example. Some of you ha may have seen the, um, press conference in Staten Island. There's also been an ins a few incidences in the Bronx, and collectively at 3 47, which is the junior high school and elementary school for the deaf, there are a number of children who've had their busing services taken away from them. They are there at that school for both cultural
02:35:20.055 --> 02:36:01.285
and linguistic reasons. The unfortunate part about this is that the DOE has the legal department of the DOE has chosen to enforce a ruling about providing information to the DOE by June one that was created in 2007. It has never been implemented like this, and families are unaware. When questioned, I was told that families get a due process Notice the due process notice is 42 pages. It's difficult enough for a person
02:36:01.635 --> 02:36:40.325
who is English speaking to understand it. It's almost impossible for someone who is not well educated in our legal system to understand it. I'd also like to bring two things to your attention. When I walked in here today, there was steps to come up to this auditorium. The individuals at the door, while kind did not know where the accessible site is, the accessible access is. Additionally, if I'm at home and watching this online,
02:36:40.735 --> 02:37:15.725
I can turn on my closed captioning. While I understand that requesting an A SL interpreter take some time and should be done well before this meeting, I am dumbfounded that you don't have real time captioning. This is silly outside of the fact that for most of us, we mumble when we get up to a microphone. And it was very hard to hear some of the people who spoke tonight with real time captioning. Not only a deaf person, but a hearing person could hear and understand what was being said, whether it was
02:37:15.725 --> 02:37:59.935
Eloquent or not. Was it material? It was being said. Shirley next year. Thank you. Thank you. Hi, I'm Christina Collins. I'm Director of Education Policy for the UFT. Um, I'm here tonight, uh, both to, uh, bring, uh, back the issue of our, uh, occupational physical therapist who spoke at last month's meeting. Um, they did share, they did share as requested an overview of their concerns about the outsourcing of their work, particularly in District 75 as of right now.
02:37:59.935 --> 02:38:27.895
Um, as of the last time I spoke to 'em a couple days ago, they had not yet received a response from what they had sent to the pep. So if you could just confirm that that message was received from them and let them know if you have any additional questions, that would be great. The primary reason I'm here tonight, though, is to speak to the student privacy regulation, which was, uh, removed from tonight's agenda, but, which I understand is likely to appear on, uh, an upcoming agenda.
02:38:28.245 --> 02:39:09.375
And, uh, to that, I just wanna read a very brief, uh, statement, um, that the ts uh, about the t's concerns around this issue. We're particularly concerned that the proposed changes would, rather than strengthening student privacy, protect protections, uh, would weaken them. Um, the state law passed in 2014, we think is a good model and, uh, includes, uh, safeguards for student data protections that address the issues that are intensifying with the increased access to student data by private vendors and by private companies. Um, however, upon review of the regulations
02:39:09.375 --> 02:39:42.815
as they were proposed, we believe they do not align with that 2014 law with other state regulations or with state, uh, department of Education guidance. Um, and we stand with the Parent Coalition per Student privacy. And the more than 3000, uh, advocates and students and teachers and parents who have already reached out to you on this, we are concerned that you may not have received, uh, those messages of concern about this issue. Uh, we believe in particular, that any student data be to be shared would require parental consent
02:39:43.235 --> 02:40:26.505
and should comply with HIPAA and state standards, and that any security measures implement, uh, require by state law should be clearly reflected in any contract and aggressively required by the DOE of all vendors. Thank you. Thank you. I have called all the speakers who have signed up for public comment. I mean, yeah, we're gonna check. You can sign. Yeah, but they would've had to sign up for the, uh, they should have signed up for, um, second.
02:40:28.185 --> 02:41:30.285
They should signed up for, for both. Yeah. I don't know. I, um, okay. Same thing happened last month. Hold on one sec. Hold on one minute. My apologies. Technology, um, I'm, I will call the names people who signed up for both. Okay. So I will go back to Emily Haynes Elona, Nene, Kamala Carmen, um, clear Salas and Martina Meyer. I want to speak to not just the assessments, but what we're talking about in terms of teacher expertise in designing and implementing our own curriculum.
02:41:30.315 --> 02:41:58.645
My school is under a mandate from our superintendent that we have to teach a specific ELA curriculum and a specific math curriculum on a specific pacing that does not allow us to differentiate or meet the needs of our students. As it was pointed out earlier by one of the panel members, we're in a time when our amazing New York City office of Student Pathways recognizes that not all students are on the same post-secondary pathway. Nysed recognizes the need for alternatives to regents assessments,
02:41:58.705 --> 02:42:30.745
but somehow our city education leaders, or our mayor, or whoever it is that is in charge of this, does not acknowledge that curriculum cannot be uniform. Uniformity is not equity and uniformity is not excellence. I am also confused as to why there seems to be a conflation between teaching children to read using phonics and an ELA curriculum. People think that because of the science of reading, we need to tell teachers exactly which books to teach and when, which is an ELA curriculum. It is not phonics at my school,
02:42:31.125 --> 02:43:07.905
which is a sixth to 12 school. We graduated in June of 20 24, 17, 17 12th graders who started with us in sixth grade in phonics interventions because we understand that we can teach them a top quality teacher created curriculum during their ELA period and give them a phonics intervention such that when they graduated from us this past June, after seven years of being with us, they got accepted to multiple post-secondary pathways colleges and universities. Because we know how to do this well. Now our hands are tied.
02:43:08.165 --> 02:43:35.805
We have this scripted curriculum that we have to teach. We are not meeting the needs of our students. It is not culturally responsive. It does not respect our expertise as teachers. It takes the power away from the teachers. It takes the joy out of the teaching and the learning. Our te our students are reading and writing less. That does not make any sense. They're not even finishing the books, the curriculum, the ELA curriculum, the EL ELA curriculum that we're using does not require students to ever finish a book.
02:43:40.905 --> 02:44:16.755
Thank you. Next speaker, please. Good evening. Once again, two minutes with so much to say. 'cause Manhattan is on fire right now. Um, I do wanna echo the sentiments of the parents at Beacon as a, as a current consortium parent, um, and somebody that supported, uh, the principal when they came in, I've seen and lived those concerns. Um, superintendent Alan Chang has provided the supports. The consortium has also provided supports for the principal. And there's a lot to be said
02:44:16.755 --> 02:44:51.475
to having conversations when principals are just not a good fit. Um, I respect, um, principal Ventura in trying to take this on, but again, I, as the former borough president Appointee received a lot of concerns from these parents, and I really hope that we're actively engaging the community. Uh, the other thing that I wanna elevate was something that was just mentioned, which is, uh, the fact that we're currently revising chancellor's Regulation D two 10, um, which I, as a former parent leader, actively
02:44:51.475 --> 02:45:24.675
helped, uh, engage in the conversation of the existence because of the targeting of parents that were focused on equity, uh, policies. Um, it's been consistent, this attack that has been happening to black and Latino parent leaders, the silencing of black and latino parent leaders. And it's being done by a group of people that have hundreds and thousands of dollars donated to them. And some of those people that have donated to them and have supported their platform also have donated to Mayor Eric Bank, Eric, Adam, sorry, um, campaign.
02:45:24.675 --> 02:45:58.665
And so we beg, begged to question why these particular parents have actually gotten a platform in our spaces in order to push, uh, push out a lot of the equity policies as we have seen in this administration. Um, the lack of integration in our schools. And it's very unfortunate that first, uh, deputy Chancellor Dan Weissberg has been one that has given them this platform. Uh, because it's been two minutes, I'll yield my time. Thank you. Next speaker, please.
02:45:58.665 --> 02:46:30.005
Um, I signed up to speak again during the general comments section because as a public school teacher, I'm very afraid of what feels like the death of public education with the ongoing onslaught of privatization. Uh, now this certainly feels like one of the goals of mayoral control, but considering that a majority of the pep uh, members are mayoral appointees, uh, it feels, um, useless to highlight the destructiveness of mayoral control. Instead, I'm gonna ask you all to really think deeply about whether what we are asking
02:46:30.505 --> 02:47:00.485
and mandating NYC public school students, if you would feel okay having your own child be in that position. Would you feel okay having your child locked in a room, taking an assessment that serves zero purpose hours or days on end? Would you feel okay? Having your child sit through canned curricula that is culturally destructive? And having worked as part of the literacy collaborative that was disbanded, we vetted those curricula and our recommendation was
02:47:00.905 --> 02:47:42.265
that these are not based in any science of reading, and we were told that they were gonna go through anyways. So things like HMH, just to give you a little taste, and it goes beyond just one curriculum because there is no standard curriculum that can respond and fit the needs of 1.1 million students. But just so that we know, I want folks to really think about the 12th grade. HMH curricula only features white authors. There's not a single author of color in the 12th grade. Similarly in the 11th grade, you also have very few, uh, authors of color when you, uh,
02:47:42.425 --> 02:48:13.705
when they speak about enslaved persons in the curricula, they refer to them as servants, essentially whitewashing our history of slavery. Um, and so I really, when I hear the consortium schools, I'm like, why is it that some schools and communities get exemptions from the curricula, get responsive curricula and not all of our students? If you would not be okay with your child having that curricula, how are we forcing this on all kids? And finally, please reinstate Chancellor, please reinstate Taj Sutton. We have reinstated Maude Marin, who has said transphobic
02:48:14.085 --> 02:48:45.985
and racist things to CC two. It is only right that re reinstate ta su Sutton and incredible parent leader who has fought for equity, anti-racism, and culturally responsive curricula in Brooklyn. And for all students across the city, it is only right that we actually reinstate someone who is democratically elected. Thank you. Um, me. Oh, okay. Um, hi. First, I wanna welcome our new chancellor. Um, in your remarks earlier tonight, uh,
02:48:45.985 --> 02:49:12.485
you echoed the statements that appeared in a recent Chalkbeat article. In those remarks you said you wanted to continue Chancellor Bank's signature initiatives, NYC reads and NYC solves. You also said you'd be listening to parents and educators. Unfortunately, these things are inherently contradictory. Ah, NYC reads. And now, NYC solves work, to my knowledge, rolled out without regard to general parent educator feedback. The imposition of specific mandated curriculum in New York
02:49:12.795 --> 02:49:37.195
City public school system-wide in a system, um, that it has a great number and wide variety of students is Ill-advised, um, curriculum. These curriculum are accompanied by strict pacing guides that are supposed to be followed, quote unquote, with fidelity. This is a new thing in this system. My own children were lucky enough to attend the handful of progressive public schools in the city. I'm so relieved that they learned to read and calculate before the adoption of these one size fits all private
02:49:37.445 --> 02:50:03.475
equity owned curriculum. These would've precluded the wonderful child centered and culturally responsive experiences they had. They would've tied the hands of their wonderful creative education professionals that use NYC as their classroom. Something that will be harder to make happen using a national curriculum designed to please the denizens of Texas and Florida. Before finishing, I wanna say that the complaints of parents of children with dyslexia and other language-based learning issues, um, uh, um,
02:50:03.695 --> 02:50:33.275
are legitimate about teaching reading legitimate. But the response of mandated curriculum by NYC reads is not the way, it is not the way it's for every student in the system. It's questionable. What's even helpful for dyslexic students as these particular curriculum are not phonics-based. When we look at private schools, which specialize in working with children on reading, they work one-on-one or in very small groups. So maybe this DOE, we should be more focused on reducing class size rather than enriching private equity corporations.
02:50:35.255 --> 02:51:03.285
Yes, thank you. Martina Meyer. Again, I'm speaking, um, my personal behalf, not as an employee, but as a concern to citizen and taxpayers. Dr. Pete did ask the teachers to identify the challenges exactly that we face. So I'm telling you the i-Ready assessment that we are forced to implement does not tell us what standards were assessed for our students. We don't see any information beyond the i-Ready abbreviated report. We never see what series of questions the students were asked, the nature
02:51:03.585 --> 02:51:30.885
of their errors or what questions specifically, um, they were they were going through. It's concerning that we are being told something different from what we are actually experiencing. Please listen. We are telling you that all across the city, all teachers using i-Ready do not have any way of doing error analysis. We don't see what standards were assessed. We don't see what questions were asked. We watch our students click through and guess because they quickly figure out
02:51:31.265 --> 02:51:59.125
that the questions keep getting harder. And so they want to get it done as fast as possible. It's the design of the program that this body has put millions of dollars into. And the fact that DOE officers don't seem to know how this works or are acting like this is an individual problem or a school level problem is alarming. But unfortunately not surprising. This is a central de design feature of i-Ready. And it means that the assessment is not at all helpful to teachers. Beyond that, we need you to hear us that there are too many
02:51:59.125 --> 02:52:23.965
of these assessments, regardless of whether or not we have access to the data. And we need every moment that we have to take our work seriously in our instructional time. It feels like the central offices don't take our work seriously. What we do see in central offices is a lot of bloated salaries. And I would be remiss to omit that this is outrageous, that the mayor's partner has had a no-show job with a big old six figure salary. The corruption is eroding our trust.
02:52:24.225 --> 02:53:10.735
And I'm calling for the mayoral appointees on the pep to step down in light of the scandal surrounding the mayor, every contract should be called into question and there should be an audit from the comptroller's office. I have so much more to say thank you in five seconds is not enough. Uh, Johanna Bjork and Lupe Hernandez. Hello there, pep. Um, my name is Johanna Bjork. I'm here as the parent as again, as you heard before, but I also was a member of the class size working group. And I am very happy to see so many people who I worked so hard for with on that work.
02:53:11.525 --> 02:53:40.625
Um, I'm speaking tonight only as in my capacity as a parent. Um, one of the things that's been buzzing that we heard about here that's been in the press is the upcoming mergers and consolidations and closures that are coming. And I think that it, you know, many of us have been seeing that coming down, but those of us who are data inclined, uh, have been seeing that coming for a while. We've been hearing about schools that are too small, unsustainable unviable, and yet we don't hear any strategy around it. Um, I went to the Office of District planning meetings
02:53:41.245 --> 02:54:11.865
because I'm like that. And, uh, um, was really surprised to hear that there is a merger considered for being in considered for my building. When I brought that to my principal, it was new news to her. I'm on the SLT, I brought the SLT and it was news to the SLT. And I really hope that as this becomes something that we look at, that it's, it's something that is done very thoughtfully. I've sat in so many pep meetings where it's been so, there's been so much trauma happening to kids,
02:54:11.975 --> 02:54:36.185
our most vulnerable kids, because it's our kids who are the most vulnerable, who are in those small schools. And as we look at those mergers and consolidations, I really hope that you center the new class size law in that I was shocked, I was appalled that the Office of District Planning did not have, was not taking that into consideration whatsoever. In their presentations or their planning, they deferred those questions. They were like, oh, well that's something
02:54:36.605 --> 02:55:12.045
that somebody else is dealing with. How is that possible? How is that possible? We have to reach 60% compliance next year. We need a strategy, not just every superintendent needs to increase by 3%, which by the way, are we gonna get any accountability reports on that? There were, um, uh, how that's going. I can't find out from my superintendent, partly because my superintendent is super citywide. So there's no vehicle for hearing from him other than a body where I personally was attacked and insulted for being a concerned parent.
02:55:12.505 --> 02:55:54.445
And I'm speaking of the CCHS, and I sent you all an email about this, um, where after I had expressed my concern about the agenda about not dealing with these issues, the president personally attacked me and invoked the D two 10 process, clearly emboldened by its suspension. Um, so much more. Um, thank you. Thank you. Good evening. Um, my name is Lupe Hernandez and I'm speaking in my own personal capacity. I wanna welcome Chancellor Avila. Thank you for, um, listening to parents and listening to us
02:55:54.705 --> 02:56:30.535
and our suggestion and bringing yourself back on the panel. Um, and actually listening and engaging with parents throughout this evening. It's actually been very refreshing. It gives us purpose to why we come here, why we do this work when we feel heard, when we feel seen. Um, I, I had originally had planned to speak on the student data and I'm very grateful to see that that was pulled along with some of the other agenda items. But I will say that this, um, is very concerning in regards to weakening our already state
02:56:30.795 --> 02:57:06.015
and federal laws that are barely being, um, upholded. Um, and I say that because we have seen many breaches, and I will tie that even to the box curriculum that we heard a lot about because I do agree I'm very lucky to be a consortium school parent. And I'm looking forward to the recommendations, um, that will come out of that Blue Ribbon Commission and being able to provide other pathways for our students to, um, excel beyond high school and especially for our students with disabilities. But the box curriculum that my younger ones in pre-K creative curriculum, some
02:57:06.045 --> 02:57:37.975
of the biggest concerns I heard from teachers was the data that is being, um, having to put, be put in. Um, I was shocked when I saw the amount of paperwork that the teachers have to do and it's taking away time from real learning inside the classroom. And I think that we need to really invest the money because none of our kids are learning at the same level. We need to differentiate. We need to meet them where they're at. And these box curriculums do not allow for that to happen. But we've been saying that month after month
02:57:37.975 --> 02:58:12.395
after month, I will say my last thing is we need to reinstate Taj Sutton, D two 10. Uh, you need to reevaluate and also reconsider, we still have Chancellor 8 8 30 that also, uh, you know, um, addresses dis anti-discrimination that folks are experiencing here. Thank you. Thank you. I believe that now I have gotten through all of the speakers and the general public comment. Great to you, Chair fa Thank, thank you very much.
02:58:12.655 --> 02:58:45.035
Yes. Panel member chair. Thank, thank you. Um, do you mind if I just make a quick comment? My son done fell asleep underneath the clock and he gotta be up at 5:00 AM to get on the five, like 30 ferry. So do you mind if I just make a quick comment and, you know, get 'em home? Absolutely. Go ahead. Thank you. Um, I wouldn't make it outta here if I didn't. Uh, yeah, go ahead. Um, I just wanna say, first of all, chancellor, thank you for joining us on the stage.
02:58:45.935 --> 02:59:27.115
It is very important as the community has stated, um, for you to be present with us so that we all feel like we are in this together. So thank you and welcome. Um, I also want to say to my, uh, colleague from Bronx, uh, happy birthday. Happy birthday Rema. And I'm gonna make my, my comments brief tonight. 'cause again, I gotta get my son home. And, um, so I want everybody sitting here at this table to really understand that the decisions we make impact real people
02:59:27.145 --> 03:00:01.265
and the decisions that we make here have real life consequences. And we hear those consequences every month when really the experts in our communities, the experts with our children are sitting in this room, right? Teachers might be experts in pedagogy, but parents are experts in their children and they bring their concerns into these spaces every month. And they tell us what works and they share with us what doesn't. And I think that we have an obligation to
03:00:01.805 --> 03:00:43.725
not just hear them, but we have an obligation to work with them as partners to make sure that this system does right by them, does right by their families, and does right by the communities that they all exist as part of. And one of the ways that we do that outside of this school board is by voting. And I say that because, and this is kind of like the off, like off topic part, but it's connected in this way. The change we want to see as a community exists
03:00:44.185 --> 03:01:16.805
in our votes, right? So today is still, it's still early voting. Go vote, right? You don't like mayoral control, go vote, right? You got state elected officials up for election and if they are supporting something that you have a problem with, go vote. Right? And, you know, election day is next Tuesday, right? We even got the, like our kids got the day off from school, right? Like, take them with you to the polls, let them see
03:01:17.225 --> 03:01:49.165
how this process works. That's why my son is sitting in the back where I started bringing him with me every month. He tired and he can't hang. And that's all right. But he's no, he's no, keep in mind, he's a, he's, he's young. He wakes up at 5:00 AM every day to be on a ferry at five 30 to be to school by eight o'clock. And then he does it all over again to come home every evening, right? And, you know, one of the things that was mentioned tonight is
03:01:49.545 --> 03:02:21.835
as we consider the decisions we make, you know, are you comfortable with your own child's dealing with the issues that we're dealing with? And I could tell you for a fact that I'm not, and I'm not because my votes have reflected the fact that I am not comfortable with a lot of the decisions and a lot of the policies that come off of this board, right? So if we are serious about changing this system in a way that works for parents and works for our students especially, and works for our educators
03:02:21.855 --> 03:03:01.645
and works for our administrators, and works for our staff, then we have to, and like we have to not just engage with them, but we have to start with the premise that we are all partners and our children are the center. And we have, like, the whole point in this is to make sure that we as a community give them the best educational experience that we can possibly give them, right? Whether that means reevaluate, co reevaluating contracts, reevaluating policies, reevaluating how we interact and deal with each other. The point is, is that we have
03:03:01.985 --> 03:03:28.805
to really take a long hard look at how we do things and we have to make the types of changes necessary to make sure that at the end of the day, our children get what they need. So with that, I just wanna say thank y'all for your understanding and I'm gonna get my son home. Okay? Thank you. And I yield back thank you Perry. Although you went way beyond the two and a half minutes that we normally, uh, uh, do that. But, um, so for the next three meetings, you owe me some, uh, time there. So, uh, but I appreciate your comments
03:03:29.045 --> 03:03:59.325
and you did allude to a birthday and I also extend happy birthday, but this must be a great month for panel members. 'cause we have three panel birthdays. Um, and I wanna recognize him as well. Panel member, uh, nave Hasan, happy birthday. It's his birthday as well. Um, Marjorie, Seb, happy birthday. It's her birthday as well. And I bet you didn't think we knew, knew this Dr. Green, our vice chair. It is our birthday as well. So happy birthday to all.
03:03:59.325 --> 03:04:29.135
We for panel members, if you come back into the next room, we do have some, uh, uh, I was gonna say light refreshment, that implies something else. Yeah, we will, uh, have a little cake in, uh, if you, if you have the availability. But yeah, happy birthday to all. Um, at this point we're gonna now turn into, uh, panel member comments, um, uh, as we close the meeting. So panel members, what I didn't do before, lemme remind you now, those pa those comments should be limited to two and a half minutes.
03:04:30.155 --> 03:05:06.395
So, um, who wants to begin? Yes, panel member, Lee. Thank you. Can I ask the audience please to, uh, before we start, Iris, opposed to leaving? Can, can you, um, come to attention come to order? Thank you. I'll be brief. Um, I have two things to say. One is a request, um, could I formally request that whomever controls these things at DIIT set the panel at NYC schools dot, you know, our panel email to automatically forward all emails that were received in that inbox to each one of our individual DOE issued inbox emails because we do not receive them.
03:05:06.495 --> 03:05:38.905
I don't know who sees them or where they land, but they do not get distributed to us individually. Um, so I would like to formally request that DIIT do that for us please, and thank you. Um, By the way, I, let me interrupt you must have been, uh, that's gonna happen. We've already made that request and, um, email will go directly to panel members. Good, because, and also, yeah, yeah. So we, we heard you on that. That's, that's gonna happen. Terrific. Um, the second thing, you know, uh, that I wanted to bring up this evening, um,
03:05:38.905 --> 03:06:13.365
and it's unfortunate, you know, I I I'm distressed by the unfortunate stories I'm hearing out of Beacon. I am a parent of an eighth grader who is a student with a disability, multiple disabilities, and I'm applying to high school right now, and I've been on a million open houses, virtual and in person. And I feel the need to elevate, um, the reality that we need to do a real check-in with our high school administrators on services for students, for special education students because I am hearing some absolutely insane
03:06:13.735 --> 03:06:58.725
and not legal things happening, um, in our schools. Everything from we phase out IEP services year over year, um, to, we don't offer ICT, um, and really bizarre gatekeeping, um, which principals are not allowed to tell us that. And it perpetuates, it perpetuates this type of segregation and this type of, um, discrimination again, against our students with disabilities and essentially funnels them into lesser sought, um, lesser resourced high schools. Um, and it's really unfortunate, and, you know, my criteria has really shifted honestly,
03:06:59.835 --> 03:07:32.705
as a parent who's going through this, this second time to, I wanna go, I wanna send my kid to anywhere that rep where principals talk about robustly, enthusiastically, and proudly implementing special education services rather than doing it with reluctance. But I, that needs to be the case at every high school. Um, and principals need to be reminded of their legal responsibility because there is really a lot of discriminatory and, um, biased policies and informal practices in place across our city. Thank you. Thank you, Adam. I, uh,
03:07:32.845 --> 03:08:03.075
why don't we just go down the line. Uh, so next, Thank you. Um, so everything we heard about Beacon, further it is evidence of broken SLT and DLT systems because if there was a functioning school leadership in that team, this situation wouldn't be happening. And it's, and if they had that equitable voice where they're talking about data and they're talking about their school and what works and what doesn't work with the teachers included and the parents and all of the mandatory members,
03:08:03.535 --> 03:08:36.765
it doesn't sound like that's happening in that school. I'd actually love a briefing about SLTs, DLTs and Title One pacs because these are all mandated, whether federally, because we received titled funding or through state law 25 90 or through city codes, et cetera. And these are broken systems that, that then you get retaliated against when you force the systems to make them functional. So this is a bigger conversation that I don't, I can't do it in two and a half minutes. Um, and, and I hope that you know that I appreciate Superintendent Chang
03:08:36.765 --> 03:09:03.995
and I hope that he is celebrated for providing this data that they are required by law to provide and not having a conversation that's more in the negative. I just wanna say that now. SLTs and dots with regards to the curriculum and what the teachers are saying and what the parents are saying, right? Some of the SLT conversations and DLT are being absorbed by the instructional leadership team and only being had with the UFT members and the CSA members or the superintendent
03:09:04.295 --> 03:09:33.035
and the teachers in their consultation. And the parents are completely excluded from those conversations. So then having a conversation about data may not even make sense when you don't understand the data. You weren't part of the conversation and now we're backtracking to explain things. So I just wanna contextualize that the IDEA complaints are outrageous. Um, ocip, uh, office of Special Education Programs, which is the U-S-D-O-E, just released a report which talks about
03:09:33.345 --> 03:10:01.045
how poorly New York City has done in the last 12 years with regards to special education. Um, beacon parents file a state complaint because your, your students, by the time it gets rectified here, are going to have graduated. Please file a state complaint. Also, the UFT complaints have been helpful for some of us, and through that UFT actually mandated that each school create a special education committee, that they have to have these discussions. But there are no parents in this committee.
03:10:01.225 --> 03:10:30.645
No parents were notified of this, but the students belong to us. So just please, when we are creating committees and task force and, and structures to fix issues include the people that the issues are affecting in high school, we can include students in those conversations. Um, and the assistive tech. To that point, I would like a briefing about assistive technology and, and how we are doing as a city. Because as a parent of three students that had assisted technology, I can tell you
03:10:30.645 --> 03:10:59.205
that I can get private school for all my kids because not one of their assisted technology mandates is being met. Not one of them. And I have to, every year ask for training for whoever the staff is, which should be a consideration when you're creating classes to make sure that they know how to use it. And to the point of the teacher and the time. Assisted technology is a great tool that reduces the amount of time that staff have to spend on prep, creating materials. There are program that have materials
03:10:59.205 --> 03:11:34.555
that are already created and vetted and differentiated that they don't have access to. I wanna see those contracts. I wanna see contracts for technology that supports staff to be able to spend more time in classrooms. And a SL interpretation, why don't we have it? Nobody in New York City can participate. There was a town hall held for, uh, busing and the amount of families that showed up for a SL interpretation. And, and, and you know what? We were like, go use the chatter, fill out the form.
03:11:36.305 --> 03:12:12.455
And do you know what these people said? That's not our language. We speak a SL They are not literate sometimes. So to tell someone to go to a website, read a form, look at passions is not reasonable. When they have learned A, B, CD, E, they do not know A, B, C, D, E. So we are completely inaccessible to a hugely underserved population that is screaming for help, but don't have a voice. Literally, literally don't. So if we can just at minimum provide a SL interpretation
03:12:12.715 --> 03:12:50.245
every month, because when we show it on the Zoom platform, it can be galleried where they're pinned to the screen and they can watch the recording and be included. They can't file busting complaints. They can't call OPT. Explain to me how we are servicing these families in a briefing. Thank you. Sure. Thank you panel member. Um, Alicia, did you have any comment? Any other, Um, I'm gonna switch, switch topics a little bit. Hello everyone. Um, so we know
03:12:50.245 --> 03:13:25.455
that class sizes are much the same as they were last year, which is super concerning. In August, I was promised a briefing on class size by Mr. Weisberg. Hi, Deanna. Um, since then, though, one of the Queen CECs has not only formed a public class size committee within their district, they've had two meetings, both of which were healthfully attended by the public and were attended by members of the superintendent's office who came with data, came with answers, and came with a very open attitude
03:13:25.595 --> 03:13:58.435
to answering questions not only from the committee members who are made up by moms of the public, but also from CEC members who they have to see every month. So I would really love an answer on when we can get that briefing. 'cause it's October now. Sorry, could you repeat the topic briefing? We will, we will definitely make sure that we'll schedule one. Thank you. Yeah, we'll go back. Panama Valley. Yep. If that's okay. Thank you.
03:13:58.615 --> 03:14:25.955
I just wanted to say thank you to the parents and the, uh, teachers that have come from Beacon High School. Uh, thank you. I've received your information and we'll be following up. Thank you. Thanks. Yes. I wanna thank everyone who came and spoke, uh, taking copious notes and we'll be following up with both, uh, DOE staff and with your, um, with yourselves as soon as possible. I wanna welcome, uh, the Chancellor.
03:14:25.975 --> 03:15:00.655
Uh, thank you for sitting with us. Uh, it's really important to see you here, uh, involved in the work together. Uh, a couple of things. I had a really productive discussion with, uh, um, with, uh, chair Shaquille is chair, I forget his title, but, uh, love him. And, and we, he wants to involve the panel in a visit to their, um, office in Brooklyn to show us what they do and, and, and sort of to get us a better idea of how we can support a lot of this stuff that needs to be done in-house, in, in my opinion, as a technologist.
03:15:00.655 --> 03:15:31.855
Uh, and, and, and have better contracts and less, less outsourcing, more insourcing, have expertise of the things that really should be done by the system. Uh, and hopefully, uh, we'll send an email and follow up. Uh, I have already a lot of interest from some members here. Um, we have, uh, continued to have lots of families living in temporary housing. Uh, that's something that I'm working on essentially on a daily basis. It's, uh, heartening to see that they're not doing the DHS evictions yet. Uh, I hope they never do them.
03:15:32.155 --> 03:16:09.765
Uh, so that the kids that are in school, uh, and have no documented status can remain both in their schools and easily commute. Uh, and, uh, nothing happens to their housing situation except for finding permanent housing during the school year. Um, and I think that's it. My time. Thank you. Thank you Ano virus. Good evening. Evening everyone. And thank you again, chancellor for joining us today. And thank you for visiting Renaissance. Um, I just was curious, just in general,
03:16:09.905 --> 03:16:36.955
just thinking about Rema, what she was saying. Is there videos that goes out, typically the parents to help them understand how to navigate our electronics at the beginning of the school year? Have they ever been considered? So I, I really love that idea. And right now we are really thinking about the multiple ways that we can engage and empower our families through social media, through written communication, verbal communication. So thank you for the, the idea
03:16:36.955 --> 03:16:58.165
and we'll definitely look to see how we can operationalize that. Thank you for that. And then regarding the assessment, I'm just curious 'cause I know I'm a parent. I was texting my daughter, like, when you take your assessment, did your teacher communicate with you? I know a parent teacher did communicate with me in my school, but for my colleagues who do have children currently in school, who has taken the assessment, have you not been communicated to from your teachers?
03:17:04.765 --> 03:17:33.015
Just curious. And I only ask that question, chancellor, because there, there is a concern in general that equity of consistency across schools about principal school leadership. You know, Rema and I have talked before, I've actually leaned on her a couple of times when I became a parent leader at Renaissance. Just making sure that I understood all of the Chancellor regulations and kind of use them at, you know, as necessary to be able to remind the principal of their expectations.
03:17:33.795 --> 03:18:05.255
So what can we do? Just curious as parents to be able to not, not fight with leadership, but better advocate to ensure that they're doing their job. Yeah. Yes, sure. So, I I want to also mention, I I am the mother of a New York City public school student as well. And one of the things that I have been very transparent about is that when I was a teacher, I was not a mother. When I was a principal, I was the mother of an infant toddler. And when I got to the, uh, the district
03:18:05.255 --> 03:18:35.925
as a deputy superintendent, acting superintendent, and then eventually here at Tweed, um, I became the mother of a school aged child. And I will be extremely transparent and say that my view of our system definitely changed and it sharpened my lens As a leader, I think we do certain things very well, and I think that there are things that need improvement. Um, I will never sit here as a mother or as an educator or as a school leader and tell you that everything is perfect and
03:18:36.505 --> 03:19:12.285
that we've done all the things. And this is why PEP and our CECs and all the additional things that we do to engage with all of you and hear you out is so important because everyone's experience as a parent is very, very different. Um, I am extremely privileged and resourced. My daughter right now is at home with my sister, uh, albeit she is going to be pretty upset with me because tomorrow's Halloween. And she's like, you better be up early and make sure that my costume is ready.
03:19:12.785 --> 03:19:58.765
Um, but I signed up for this, right? And so I say all this to say that I myself have had some interesting experiences with assessment and inconsistency in how I get feedback. Some teachers have been excellent, others have growth areas. But this is why job embedded support is so important. This is why leadership is so important. Do we have the answer to all of this? A blanket answer? No, because it's not one answer. Because as you've all pointed out, different contexts, different situations require different responses. So the best that I can do is say that I hear you.
03:19:59.505 --> 03:20:34.295
I've experienced some of this myself, and we have a lot of work to do and that's why we're here tonight and that's why we're showing up in a different way and making sure that we are listening to you. Thank you. Thank You. Vice Chair Green. Any comment? No, but I wanted just thank, uh, chancellor for being here and I just wanna say yes, it is concerning that, uh, the assessments have not been provided for parents. I know as a principal, and I think my fellow principals can,
03:20:34.445 --> 03:21:03.175
uh, attest to this, parents got letters in the mail with their assessment results and online and the children got them. And we had data meetings and we had teacher data meetings. So, uh, I'm very concerned about whatever school teachers didn't get their student assessments. Thank you. Alban. We'll go Around. Uh, good evening. Good evening everyone. I'm gonna make a comment with, I didn't plan to, but due to comments that's happening now.
03:21:03.715 --> 03:21:39.605
Um, I'm gonna add something to my closing remarks. So the current citywide superintendents, I've worked with them for the past couple of years, right? And they've been very remarkable and resourceful. I just wanna say that at this point in, in this particular, the, um, Dr. Allen Chang, the superintendent, he is, he is super, I know from experience, super pro parent and family oriented. And he also not only stop there, he want to hear from the students, right? He always encourages to self advocate, right? To self promote.
03:21:39.605 --> 03:22:07.155
'cause we don't know what they need if they don't speak to us, right? They, who better knows what they need. So I just wanna put that out there. And I'm gonna say for those parents who spoke about Beacon, he's very well aware of what's happening and he's been working on it. And he's been working with, with leadership, right? Especially with, um, DC Rucks, right? So he's aware. And, and please reach out. He will reach out back, his team will reach out back. So when it comes to that, I just had to make sure
03:22:07.535 --> 03:22:37.715
that it's clear there. Um, I just wanna summarize what everybody's saying. So if we continually or strive to do business or do what we need to do for New York City public schools through an equity lens, and equity doesn't mean we take from one and give to someone. Equity means that we provide the support and resources. Yes, everybody could take a test. I'm gonna give the ssat for example, all students are allowed. That's equality. But is it equitable?
03:22:38.015 --> 03:23:11.665
Do they have the same resources? Are we getting them prepared to be able to do those tests? That's what equity is, right? And we want equity through all lenses. So, um, I'm gonna take something from CPAC had created, um, their own acronym of act, um, for this new, the former administration. 'cause T Legal is different now 'cause we have a new chancellor. But we had asked if we continued through ACT A for accountability, communication, and transparency, we'll be able to do better.
03:23:11.765 --> 03:23:53.165
We could always strike perfection. And if we keep these in the background, right? We need to communicate with everybody, all stakeholders. We need to be transparent, um, and say what we mean. And if it's a no to say no, right? We we're, we're adults. Um, it's not doable. And say why it's not doable, right? It, you need to feel that partnership, that inclusion, that our voice matters, right? And our voice does matter. So I'm just gonna leave it like that. Let's work on act through equitable means. Thank you. Next, uh, remember, do you wanna say this?
03:23:53.345 --> 03:24:35.275
Although, although we've spoken about many things tonight, one thing is resonating with me, and that is the issue around assessment. I'm appalled to to hear that teachers are not getting the data from these assessments. That is unheard of as a principal. That never happened in my building. And it's something that the panel surely needs to review. Thank you Mama Garcia. I wasn't going to say anything either, but just because it was so long ago, I just wanna tell parents you have no idea
03:24:35.335 --> 03:25:28.035
how you are getting at least some information. It may not be enough and it may not be what you need, but I am telling you, when I was a teacher in the top school in New York Public School as an English teacher, my daughter attended the same school when I was there, and we did not get information. That's how we did not get assess. So things are changing, I'm sure not fast enough, but I am telling you parents did not get the information that you get now. And so hopefully it will keep getting better and hopefully we can be a part of helping you get better.
03:25:28.985 --> 03:26:14.045
I hope that is, um, at least some, some sauce. Thank you. Thank you, Anita. I help you, Robert. I I appreciate that. Um, yes. Um, thanks for, you know, hanging in there. I appreciate detention because it, it shows a part of humanity when you can step in a room and not have to yes, man and agree with what everybody is saying. So I, there there is, there's value in being able to speak your mind and, and get what you have to say off your chest without, um,
03:26:14.985 --> 03:26:55.875
failing as if that's something wrong. And, and it keeps communication going. Um, I have to say, it's challenging to hear. Um, you know, people say they don't want may mayor rolls on because it's time, you know, they should leave or what have you. At the end of the day, we're parents and there's a lot of parent leadership. And the reason why most of us parents are on this panel is because of the things we did not like. It's not because we, we are kumbaya
03:26:56.615 --> 03:27:36.545
and up here it is, what the heck is going on? And what do I need to know? What do I need to learn? And so once you, you get past being angry and cursing under your breath, then you have to position yourself or to ask the questions that will lead you to not, and I'm not going to look at this thing from the outside in. I wanna find out from the inside what is actually happening. And then how can we make changes? What is the language? How does things move? How long does a contract take? Okay? I wanna be a, at the head of that
03:27:37.375 --> 03:28:14.735
as a contract committee chair, you get different perspective when you actually don't complain or you limit your complaining and put your, and stand in somebody's shoes. So it's, it's not, it's not all, it's not fun at all, but it's very informative. And I know as a, which leads to my next thing. As a black woman who was raised in Brooklyn, born and raised in Brooklyn, I got a chance to see quite a few paradigm shifts. And to be uncomfortable would be an understatement.
03:28:14.735 --> 03:28:52.705
You learn how to deal with that type of discourse and do it anyway. Um, and I just wanted to share that because this is work. This is, this is actual work, and it takes time to figure things out. It takes time to, to speak a language and put it in several different languages. And I'm still talking about English, right? For people to understand how you communicate, what are people's entry points? How can they, how can I get my message across? And so to not just learn what's going on as a parent,
03:28:53.445 --> 03:29:34.495
but also learn what's going on in policy, in policy and having to do the work there. Um, and so, and, and that's the work. And I, and I stand by the, the second point is a little pet peeve of mine. I do appreciate the conversation, but I would prefer if parents did not refer to black people as blacks, the blacks. Okay? Gotta put some respect on that because again, this has to deal with, with understanding the racial harm that has been very pervasive in these settings, black people, African Americans,
03:29:34.495 --> 03:30:13.345
but the, the word blacks is, is very triggering because that, that says that, you know, you, you, you may not have recognized that. That's just not what, what we say in public settings. We're, and, and that's a part of the issue. We're grouping people. We're not blacks. So please take the S off and, and, um, you know, come up with a better phrase and, and so we can continue this conversation in a healthy way. Thank you. Thank you Quickly, hopefully, um, with respect, I do appreciate everybody who contributed today.
03:30:13.345 --> 03:30:50.125
And we probably all learned something today because we really carried, I think this conversation of assessment a lot farther. Let me just give you my perspective, just because culturally speaking, my entire life has been an assessment from where I came from. Meaning my parents always told me, my father's 98 now, that everything in his life was an assessment to get him to where he is today. So assessment is not a strange or foreign word to me. So that when we have this conversation of, um, and,
03:30:50.125 --> 03:31:36.195
and you might use a different word later in life because we aren't going to be assessed the same way now. Um, but I just want us to get used to that concept of we may not be using the same metrics at the same time, but the reality is our kids need to learn that there are calls made by their behavior, by their, uh, engagements, by their testing, by their play. And ask them to be true to themselves and learn the words that they need to of that doesn't feel right. And overall, that's when you'll get to figure out
03:31:36.975 --> 03:32:16.835
what assessment really means to them. And hopefully you will find the schools that will match to them to do the cor correct or correct assessment for them. And that's what I really took from the Beacon conversation when we did not put Beacon back in the day from my child who had more than a 5 0 4. And when you look at the website now, the leadership is listed as a 5 0 4 coordinator, which that already would've put my kid out of the running because their emphasis was a kid who had 5 0 4. So I, I found it odd to be honest, when I looked at
03:32:17.305 --> 03:32:50.635
and heard some of the mismatching that was going on right, right now. So I think that sometimes we're really not looking at really what is there and asking the right questions if the website, and that's the only thing we can really go by is what comes out of what that school says that they represent, even if, and, and to ask those pertinent questions when given that time. And, and I just looked at it as that was really difficult to hear what I had heard four or five years ago about the same school that is being talked about now, where I'm like,
03:32:50.815 --> 03:33:42.805
the assessment is no different from then that it is now, but I'm hearing individuals who assume the school should be acting in a certain way. So I just really ask that people really think through, like when they read of a school and how it is today, really understand it as does it really match up with my values. Um, first I wanna welcome the Chancellor. Um, look forward to working with you in the future. Um, so tonight, um, I heard the audience speaking about how they chose a consortium school, sorry, I can't say that word, consortium school.
03:33:42.905 --> 03:34:26.605
Um, and it made me think how proud I am of the choices New York City Public Schools offer. Um, personally I prefer a traditional school because I like to see numbers and, you know, um, decide how much I need to help my kid to succeed while preserving their happiness at the same time. Um, I think it's important, um, to keep it interesting for our students, um, when they're learning in school and the safety. So I hope that moving forward, um, these two items come first before anything else.
03:34:27.705 --> 03:35:06.835
Um, learning, being interesting and safety. Um, so for the contract item number two, um, my school, um, the SLT was able to get the principal to pilot a new geometry program in junior high school. Um, the way they picked and chose the kids to enter this program was by i-Ready scores. There were many students that were performing at eighth grade and ninth grade level math, um, in the seventh grade. And basically these kids before this, um, program was implemented, um, piloted,
03:35:06.835 --> 03:35:51.795
they were like spinning in chairs in class and they were bored. So it was nice to see that, you know, um, like a small portion of classes was being, um, piloted for a new program to see if it works instead of the whole grade. So I like this flexibility, um, that was offered and I'm glad that, you know, um, we're able to do that in New York City Public Schools. Another thing I wanna talk about is the S-H-S-A-T. Um, I hope that we get briefed regarding the new contract item that it's thought out, um,
03:35:52.055 --> 03:36:31.865
better, instead of just flipping to electronic, we wanna know the cost savings and, um, if, how it'll affect students that are not, um, as virtually, um, you know, uh, positioned. Yeah. Um, and I also wanna like state something personal. Um, so the S-H-S-A-T for many immigrant families, they view this school, this opportunity as, um, the door to the American, the American dream. So it's very important for the immigrant community to preserve these tests. And we do want to see more different
03:36:32.845 --> 03:37:14.805
populations in these schools. So we hope that we could put more money into, you know, tutoring students to reach these goals because we'll, more people will be proud of, you know, these goals being more, um, inclusive. We do like that, and I hope that we can all like, um, work together to make this happen. Thank you. Sure. When I hear the term assessment, my, my whole world changes because assessment for the men's men's school is not the same for the 75. And I'm not talking about the top 20%.
03:37:15.275 --> 03:37:50.585
I've been dealing with my son 15 years in the system. They give him the same assessment and he refuses to do it. Therefore, they have him now from a fourth grade reading level to a kindergarten level now figure that one out because they will not adjust to the way he's allowed. He's able to give the answers. If he's not interested, he's not. So therefore he doesn't do it. And they said it's okay because he can't do it. No, he can't do it. This is a child who can every day looks up every changes in the trans, he can tell you where to change what delay and everything.
03:37:50.615 --> 03:38:19.625
And now right now he's into doing, uh, he's researching going abroad. He's finding hotels in Brazil tomorrow. He is going, I don't know where I take DR for the day, but he's able to do all that. And you wanna tell me that he's reading at a kindergarten level. Hmm. So what do you really call assessment and to which group does he apply to? And I think since we brought the subject up today, we should really take a look at it, at the population that we are teaching.
03:38:20.055 --> 03:38:55.395
It is not about all the children who are going to college, it's also those who can have a future. Thank you. Thank you. Um, I know it's getting late, so I'm gonna try to be as quick as I can. Um, I just wanted to let, um, our guests and the people watching online that we did have two briefings, uh, regarding the OMNI cards. And so we are still discussing how to ensure that distribution can be made wider. I just wanted to acknowledge that
03:38:56.135 --> 03:39:33.325
because it didn't come up at all during our time tonight. Um, and I wanted to thank Dr. Ellis for continuing her work with PSAL and trying to ensure that more students are having access to sports. Um, I, I think we would be remiss not to mention the, um, ongoing deaths of students through gun violence and subway surfing. I think that we really need to start addressing this in a much, much bigger way than we've been doing. Um, $17 million for S-H-S-A-T.
03:39:33.325 --> 03:40:14.545
I would encourage all of you to try to come out to Staten Island for our next meeting and, um, voice your opinion. If I could pay for a bus, I would. Um, but just, you know, to throw out a second thought there, we might wanna use that $17 million for tutoring instead. But, um, I guess we'll talk to our state elected officials about that. Um, and then just kudos to the DOE. I'll just try to end on a, like a positive note here. Um, I don't know if any of you have heard or seen yet, but the DOE has created
03:40:15.095 --> 03:40:54.295
a school budgets at a glance document. It's a very easy to read document. All of our SLTs and DLTs and parents are gonna benefit from this. Our, our, uh, principals and teachers, anyone who was trying to navigate how on earth school funding works, it is all very, very clear and easy to read. So, um, please go to the DOE'S website, look up your school, look under the reports tab and look for school budgets at a glance. Please do this ASAP so that you understand how the funding
03:40:54.435 --> 03:41:32.585
for your school is operating. But, um, I am so very, very grateful to the DOE for putting this together because this is something that, um, parent leaders have been asking for for many years and it is just brilliantly done and so easy to read. And so thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much for that. Thank you. Thank you. Um, on behalf of the comptroller, um, I just wanna mention a couple of things that we actually haven't talked much about tonight, but, um, would like to shed some light on.
03:41:32.585 --> 03:42:13.905
Um, I would like to note that mid-November is an important time for class size rejection in New York City. Um, as doe's annual report on their implementation of their class size plan will be issued, um, the comptroller certifies that annual report and, um, as noted in the comptroller's class size plan certification letter from last June, um, doe's education expense and capital funding plans do not provide sufficient funding to reduce class size as required by state law. Um, at that time, the office of the comptroller estimated
03:42:13.925 --> 03:42:52.945
that the cost of the additional teachers required to achieve class size targets grow from a range of $374 million and $422 million of fiscal year 2026 to between 1.5 billion and 1.65 billion at full implementation in fiscal year 2028. Um, we have seen no evidence of proactive planning for implementation, especially in terms of funding schools. And I mentioned this because we have visited schools where principals have told us that they actually have the space to reduce class size,
03:42:53.005 --> 03:43:35.235
but they do not have the funding to hire the teachers needed, um, for the additional classrooms. Um, and they don't know of any communication from DOE on how compliance at the school level will actually work. Um, we would like to suggest that DOE move more proactively to adjust the way in which they fund schools to reduce class size because current funding is not going to work. Um, and the state must consider class size as it gets set to implement changes to the foundation aid formula. Finally, I want to uplift, um, the,
03:43:36.375 --> 03:44:15.995
um, the issue of school accessibility. Um, the new school construction authority five-year capital plan amendment comes out in two days on November 1st. And there has been no more funding added to that plan for school accessibility at $800 million. Um, and given inflation and other cost increases, the this amount represents virtually no increase in the investment over the last five year plan. Children of this city cannot continue to rely on inadequate bus transportation to get to far away schools, just
03:44:17.215 --> 03:44:53.365
because their own neighborhood school is inaccessible. OMB and school construction authority and DOE need to work together to come up with the additional 450 million million that advocates have been asking for for this school year, for improving school accessibility. Thank you. Great. Well, thank you. I want to thank all of you before I, um, bring down the gavel on tonight's meeting and announce that. And, um, Wednesday, November 20th, we'll meet again and do this all over again at the Michael Petrie School.
03:44:54.025 --> 03:45:28.165
Um, I did want to thank also, uh, make note of a few things. One, and some of the things we referenced tonight really involve policy and you, I think you referenced some things that involve state policy and the need to lobby. So, um, I will be, um, appointing a committee to address some of these things to do with, um, legislation and policy and to create a sort of an agenda of things that, that the count that the, that we as a panel field would be important. So there are a number of issues that really we keep butting our heads and we keep hearing this as a state mandate. This is a state requirement
03:45:28.165 --> 03:45:53.085
and, uh, yet our voice is not often heard in these state conversations. So we'll be, uh, working on, I've drafted something, I'll send that out. But Pam Imma, uh, offer a comment and we'll be moving forward with a committee that actually will do something around that, um, legislative affairs and policy and really do something so that we're engaged in these conversations. And so we we're not just constantly coming back and reacting and saying, well, that's a state rule.
03:45:53.505 --> 03:46:25.335
The state requires us to do these things, but we're not in any way having our voices heard in the state. And, um, and so that's something that, um, you'll be hearing more about very shortly. Chancellor, I definitely wanna thank not only being here, but staying for the entire meeting. Um, you know, I feel that's like an inauguration, like, you know, right there with us. So I mean that, that means a lot sometimes and leader and leadership and, um, you know, it means a lot. And I want people to know that it,
03:46:25.335 --> 03:46:58.295
that it doesn't go unnoticed when people go out, when they do those types of things. On a personal level, there were two items on the agenda scheduled, um, uh, eight, um, eight 20, and also the specialized high school exam. And when I started hearing concerns, I approached the, uh, chancellor and I said, look, can we postpone this? Can we put some time to get to have more conversation? And they were very receptive to that. Um, you know, um, and, and so that also is appreciated. So, so I think that we're, you know, there are a lot of challenges that we have in front of us,
03:46:58.965 --> 03:47:24.655
but I think we also should be mindful of the opportunities that we have in front of us. We have a lot of great opportunities. We may not all view the same way as to how to get to accomplish these things, but I think we're all headed in the same direction. We all wanna achieve some of the same kinds of things. So with that, um, let's keep that, let's leave with a positive focus. We're, we're on the move, we're gonna do some great things. Uh, yes. Can we get an update on the Citywide Safety Committee?
03:47:24.815 --> 03:47:43.055
We did ask last month. I haven't heard anything since the last part meeting, so I just wanna say that Before I will make sure that we get an update. Um, you know, gimme a few days and I'll make sure we get an update on that. Um, so again, thank you all for coming out, thank members of the public. And with that, we'll see everybody next month in Staten Island. With that, this meeting is adjourned. I hollow.
